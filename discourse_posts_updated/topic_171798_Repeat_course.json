The policy applies to courses with grades A, B, C, D, or E. Key details include:\n\n*   Students can repeat courses to improve grades, with the highest grade recorded.\n*   The total number of courses, including repeats, must be within the CCC limit.\n*   Course fees for \"Repeat for Improvement\" courses are double the normal fee.\n*   Improvement courses can be registered at any level (e.g., a foundation course at the diploma level).\n*   It is recommended that learners prioritize new courses over repeating existing ones, unless repetition is deemed necessary for improvement.\n*   All course materials from completed courses are available to the learner.",
