      "image_description": "Here is a description of the image provided, including key parameters and topics:\n\n**Overall Description:**\n\nThe image displays a screen capture of a user interface, likely from an online learning platform or a quiz/assessment website. It shows user login information, a logout option, and a section displaying a list of recent saves along with associated scores and timestamps.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1.  **User Login:** The text \"You are logged in as 23f3004246@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.\" indicates the currently logged-in user's email address, likely associated with an academic institution.\n2.  **Logout Button:** The \"Logout\" button suggests the user has the option to end their current session. This button is highlighted in red. This is a standard feature in almost every application for a secure experience\n3.  **Recent Saves Section:** This section lists the user's recent activity.\n\n    *   The title \"Recent saves (most recent is your official score)\" suggests the list shows previous attempts or versions of something, and the most recent save is the one that counts.\n    *   Each entry includes:\n        *   A \"Reload\" button (likely to revert to that saved state).\n        *   A timestamp in the format \"3/2/2025, [Time] PM.\" indicating when the save was made.\n        *   A \"Score\" value.\n\n**Parameters & Topics:**\n\n*   **User Account:** Information related to the logged-in user (email address).\n*   **Session Management:** The ability to log out of the system.\n*   **Data Persistence:** The system saves user progress or scores periodically.\n*   **Time Tracking:** Timestamps are recorded to indicate when saves occurred.\n*   **Scorekeeping:** Numerical scores are associated with each save.\n*   **Version Control/History:** The \"Recent saves\" section acts as a version history, allowing users to potentially revert to previous states.\n\n**Purpose/Context:**\n\nThe image likely represents part of an application where users complete tasks (e.g., quizzes, assignments), and their progress is automatically saved. The \"Recent saves\" feature provides a way to track attempts and see how scores have changed over time. The highlighted Logout button is there to guide the user towards securely logging out once they're done with their session.",

      "image_description": "Here's a concise description of the image:\n\nThe image displays information about a \"Tools in Data Science\" course, labeled as a \"NEW COURSE\". It presents a breakdown of assignment scores for each of the first five weeks:\n\n*   Week 1: 100.00\n*   Week 2: 85.00\n*   Week 3: 100.00\n*   Week 4: 110.00\n*   Week 5: 100.00\n\nIt also indicates that the user was \"Absent\" for \"PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1\".\n\nA call to action button at the bottom reads \"Go to Course page >\". This suggests the image is part of a course management system or online learning platform where students can track their progress and access course materials. The individual grades for weekly assignments are highlighted to show the performance of the student.",

I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update.\nBottom line: wait till Tuesday\nBoth bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then.\nIf not let us know\nKind regards.",
