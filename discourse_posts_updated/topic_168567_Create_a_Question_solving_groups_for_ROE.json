Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. \nWhat does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. \n\nImplicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”\nExplicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”\n\nSome may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. \nSome, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time…\n  \n\n",
