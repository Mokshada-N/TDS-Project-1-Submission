      "content": "@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\nI got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.\nShall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?",

      "content": "Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.\nSir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.\nSir it is a humble request to please consider it.\nWarm Regards,\nSatvik Sawhney\n23f2003680\nScreenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.53.10 PM1889×467 54 KB",
