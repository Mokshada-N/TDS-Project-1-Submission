We will be sharing some important information during that session which will help you for your ROE. It is available in your google calendar.\nThe meet link for that session is:\nROE Preparation - TDS\nFriday, February 28 · 8:00 – 10:00pm\nTime zone: Asia/Kolkata\nVideo call link: https://meet.google.com/nnq-sxqh-ryw\nThe session will be recorded and live streamed on YouTube.\nIt will be available on the TDS YouTube Playlist later.\nKind regards,\nTDS Team\nUpdate 4\n27/02/2025 7:18pm\nDear Learner,\nPlease find the link to Mock ROE 3 below.

The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.\nAfter the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).\nTo check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.\ninputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')\ntextboxes = document.querySelectorAll(\"textarea\")\nbuttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button\")\ninputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\nbuttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\ntextboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\n\nDo not submit or save your answers.\nAll the best!\nKind regards\nTDS Team\nUpdate 2\n26/02/2025 11:00 am\nWe will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).\nThe link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.\nWe will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).\nKind regards,\nTDS Team\n\nUpdate 1\n25/02/2025 7:46pm\nWe have now closed the mock submissions.\nBoth the dataset and the form submissions will reopen after tonights live session.\n\nAnnouncement\n25/02/2025\nThis same information is available in the seek portal as well.\nThe data for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:\nJivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1\nThe questions for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:\nhttps://forms.gle/UWhvLQvjrJmnvMSn6\nIMPORTANT: We will accept only a single submission of the Mock Question Form. Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end.\nThe form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm.\nWe have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins.\nWe will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight.\nAll the best!",

      "content": "@23f2003413\nWe will have it uploaded sometime this morning.\nIt has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\n\nThe chaos of ROE.\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\nHow limited the time is.\n\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\nToday’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\nKind regards",

Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know the answer to that question for others.

      "content": "Respected @s.anand , @Jivraj , @carlton\nBased on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.\nAs you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.\nI genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet  the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.\nYour understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.\nBest Regards,\nLakshay",

The company specializes in deploying large language models (LLMs) and ensuring they adhere to strict security policies.  A key part of their security process involves testing the LLMs' adherence to instructions and resistance to manipulation.\n\nThe current task involves chatting with an LLM that has been specifically instructed to never say the word \"Yes\". The challenge is to craft a prompt that will trick or coerce the LLM into saying \"Yes\", specifically with the correct casing. The highlighted sections emphasize the word \"Yes\" and its case sensitivity, stressing that any correct prompt needs to elicit this exact response from the LLM.  The task simulates a potential attack vector to expose vulnerabilities and improve system security. An \"AI Proxy token\" needs to be used. It also warns to not change the correct answer, as it will get a different answer next time.\n",
