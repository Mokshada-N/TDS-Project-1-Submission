The text is highlighted with a semi-transparent dark blue overlay, presumably to make it stand out. Behind the text, the background consists of various colorful and geometric illustrations representing different aspects of data, technology, and development. These include charts, graphs, a globe, electronic components, pencils, and other symbols related to learning and progress. The entire composition is contained within an orange frame. The emphasis is on highlighting the specific week and session number to draw attention to the content being presented during that time.",
