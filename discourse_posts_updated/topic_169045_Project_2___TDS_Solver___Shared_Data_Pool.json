      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image:\n\nThe image displays the Jolly Roger of the Straw Hat Pirates from the anime series One Piece.  It features a black flag waving against a partly cloudy blue sky. The flag is emblazoned with a white skull and crossbones, where the skull is wearing a straw hat with a red band. This hat is significant, as it is Monkey D. Luffy's signature hat and symbol of the crew. The hat on the skull distinctly marks this Jolly Roger as belonging to Luffy's crew. The flag is attached to a wooden mast, visible to the left of the frame. The overall style is cartoonish and clearly anime-inspired.",
