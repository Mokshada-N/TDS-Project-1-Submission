      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image, including the highlighted portions and key parameters:\n\n**Overall Description:**\n\nThe image shows a split-screen view related to a programming exam or assignment involving the creation of a FastAPI proxy server.  On the left is a web browser displaying the exam instructions and a submission form. On the right is a VS Code window showing API requests made with Thunder Client, along with the terminal output.\n\n**Left Side (Exam/Problem Statement):**\n\n*   **Context:**  The exam has a timer (00:26:36 left) and a score of 0/10.  The current question involves writing a FastAPI proxy server.\n*   **Task:** The student needs to create a FastAPI application that acts as a proxy. It must:\n    *   Fetch data from a URL provided in the request.\n    *   Add a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) header: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` to the response.\n*   **Example:** An example request is provided to illustrate how the URL parameter should be handled: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3Fkey3Dvalue` should fetch data from `https://example.com/?key=value` and return it with the CORS header.\n*   **Submission:** There's a field to input the FastAPI proxy URL endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`).\n*   **Highlighted:**\n    *   The input field for the FastAPI Proxy URL endpoint and the \"Error: Incorrect response\" message are highlighted with a red border. This indicates that the entered URL didn't pass the automated tests.\n\n**Right Side (VS Code and Thunder Client):**\n\n*   **Thunder Client:** This is an extension within VS Code that is used to make HTTP requests. It is like Postman.\n*   **API Request:** The active request is a `GET` request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%`. The URL parameter is a URL-encoded version of `https://example.com/?`.\n*   **Status:** The HTTP status code is `200 OK`.\n*   **Response:** The response body shows the HTML content from the example domain, including \"Example Domain\" and \"This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents.\"  This suggests the proxy server successfully retrieved and returned the data.\n*   **Terminal Output:** The terminal shows a log of various API requests, including successful (200 OK) and unsuccessful (422 Unprocessable Entity) responses. The output also logs the requests made to the FastAPI server and the URLs that were requested.\n\n**Parameters & Topics:**\n\n*   **FastAPI:** A Python web framework used for building APIs.\n*   **Proxy Server:** A server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.\n*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** A browser security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.  The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header allows requests from any domain.\n*   **URL Encoding:** Converting special characters in a URL to a format that can be transmitted over the internet. `%3A` is a URL-encoded colon, `%2F` is a forward slash, `%3F` is a question mark and `%3D` is an equal sign.\n*   **API Testing:** Using tools like Thunder Client to test API endpoints.\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** 200 OK (successful request), 422 Unprocessable Entity (the server understands the request entity, but it was unable to process the contained instructions).\n\n**Why are things highlighted?**\n\nThe \"Incorrect response\" error highlights that the submitted URL does not pass the automated test that executes after submission. The automated test validates the API endpoint and verifies if it returns the data with the required CORS headers.  The student needs to debug their FastAPI proxy server to ensure it correctly fetches the data, adds the CORS header, and returns the correct response for the automated test.\n",

      "image_description": "Here's a precise description of the image, including highlights and their likely significance:\n\n**Overall Description:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a terminal or console output. It shows the execution of a Python script that uses the `tabula-py` library to extract tables from a PDF file. The output includes installation messages, progress updates on file processing, warnings related to font handling by the PDF extraction library, and the extracted table data.\n\n**Key Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Libraries/Packages:** The script relies on several Python packages, including `tabula-py`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `distro`, `python-dateutil`, `pytz`, `tzdata`, and `six`. The output confirms that these packages are already installed and satisfy the version requirements.\n*   **File Processing:** The script processes a PDF file named \"q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf\". The output indicates the file size (167477 bytes), the last modified date (02/03/2025), and the completion status (100%). The extracted table is being saved.\n*   **Table Extraction:** The script successfully extracted tabular data from the PDF. The table contains the following columns: \"Maths\", \"Physics\", \"English\", \"Economics\", \"Biology\", and \"Group.\" There are 5 rows of data in the table (indexed from 0 to 4). The data appears to be student scores in different subjects and a group assignment.\n*   **Data Types:** The script correctly identified the data type of each column as `int64`. The overall dtype is 'object'.\n*   **Error Handling and Warnings:** The output includes warnings related to the `tabula.backend` and fallback fonts (`LiberationSans` for `Symbol` and `ZapfDingbats`). These warnings indicate that the script encountered issues with font rendering during PDF processing. This might affect the accuracy of the table extraction, especially if the PDF uses unusual or non-standard fonts. The stderr means standard error.\n\n**Highlights and Significance:**\n\n*   `Requirement already satisfied...`: Indicates that the necessary Python packages are already installed and up-to-date.\n*   `q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf...`: This is the name of the PDF file being processed by the script.\n*   `WARNING: tabula.backend:Got stderr...`:  These warnings are important because they indicate potential issues with the table extraction process. The use of fallback fonts suggests that the original fonts in the PDF were not properly handled, which could lead to inaccurate or incomplete table extraction. One should investigate these warnings to ensure the extracted data is reliable.\n*   The extracted table data is of course highlighted to ensure that data extraction was successful.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe image illustrates a table extraction process using `tabula-py` and its dependencies. The script successfully processed a PDF file and extracted tabular data, but it also encountered warnings related to font handling. These warnings need to be addressed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the extracted data.\n",

The question asks the user to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between two columns of data (A and B). Instructions are provided to calculate the sample correlation coefficient using Python, Excel, or Javascript, ensuring that there are no missing values, and to round the answer to 3 decimal places. An answer input field is present, but is highlighted in red and an error message \"Error! Failed to fetch. Please contact the exam team for assistance.\" is displayed. This indicates a problem retrieving or processing data, possibly a server issue or a client-side error preventing the question from functioning properly. The time left, score, and save options are available at the top. The \"Save\" and answer input field being highlighted in red indicates something has gone wrong, specifically an error fetching the data.\n",

I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.\nEven after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.\nEven if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.\nPlease consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted\nrollnumber 23f2001390",
