It features the title \"Deploy your application\" in a large, white font. Below a thin horizontal line, it provides a description: \"Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel.\"\n\n**Highlighting and Purpose:**\n\n*   **\"Vercel\"**: The mention of \"Vercel\" at the end of the description is likely highlighted to promote or showcase that Vercel is a supported (or preferred) platform for deployment. It serves as a specific example within the more general statement about using \"any platform.\" This could be because the user is already on the Vercel platform and the website is recommending deployment to Vercel itself.",

      "content": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\nDear Sir,\nI have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don‚Äôt think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.\n\nIn GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI gh  which we have to install in the vercel instance using apt package manager.\nBut, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.\nIn GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?\nAlso after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install ngrok package.\nIn GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires docker package installed.\nIn GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?\nMany ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?\nAnd many more\n\nMost tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.\nVercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.\nMany of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.\nI can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.\nAlso, some ques requires external toolings like\n\nIn GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.\nIn GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?\nGA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can‚Äôt be installed locally.\n\nHow to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.\nAlso, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like\n\nIn GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI.\nSome ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used ‚ÄúSave as‚Äù to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?\n\nAnother concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.\nPlease advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.",

Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.\n\n\nCurrently answers that we have entered for GA‚Äôs 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we‚Äôve entered as well for verification purposes.\n\n\nThe first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.\n\n\nCan you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?\n\n\nHow do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.\n\n\nThanks and Regards\nShalini",

For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.\nAlternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I‚Äôm curious about your preference.\nAdditionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.\nYour editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll spend most of your time, so make sure you‚Äôre comfortable with it.\nVisual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you‚Äôll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.\nTo get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:\n\nGetting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)\nCode Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)\nProductivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)\nPersonalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)\nExtensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)\nDebugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)\nVersion Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)\nCustomize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)\n\nAI Editors: Copilot, Cursor\nNote: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer‚Äôs toolkit. Please make sure to use them.\nTo install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type code -s, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.\nWhat is the output of code -s? The output of code -s cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user‚Äôs system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.\nAs for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent.

The command is making an HTTP POST request to an API endpoint hosted on Vercel (`https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/`). The request sends two fields: \"question\" and \"file.\" The \"question\" field contains a long string describing a series of actions to perform on a downloaded file and the \"file\" field contains qmove.zip file path.

The image highlights this URL to indicate it's a placeholder that needs to be replaced with the actual address of the API.\n\nFurthermore, the image clarifies that the endpoint requires a `POST` request to the same URL. The highlights emphasize how the API endpoint handles the POST request and also it can be seen that this highlighted portion specifies the method and endpoit for the request. The post request is expected to include a question and optionally file attachments, which should be formatted as `multipart/form-data`. This is commonly used for uploading files along with other form data.",

      "image_description": "Here's a precise description of the email image, taking highlighted parts and important parameters into account:\n\n**Overall Description:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of an email from IITM BS Team regarding the \"Tools in Data Science\" course, specifically outlining eligibility criteria for the final exam and details about course grading. The email provides a table summarizing the assessment components, their opening and submission dates, and peer review dates. It also defines the formula for calculating the final course score (T) based on various components.\n\n**Highlighted Parts and their Significance:**\n\n*   **\"Eligibility to attend the end term exam: Average of best 2 out of the first 5 weekly assessment scores >= 40/100\"**: This is a key requirement. Students need to achieve a minimum score by averaging their best two scores from the first five weekly assessments to be eligible to sit for the final exam. The highlighting emphasizes the importance of this criteria.\n*   **\"Eligibility to get the course grade: Attending end-term exam\"**: This states that attending the final exam is mandatory to receive a grade in the course.\n*   **\"Final course score T= 0.1GAA+0.2 ROE1+0.2 P1+0.2P2+0.3F\"** and **\"Final course score T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2P2+0.25F\"**: These are the formulas used to calculate the final course score.\n*    **Table headings**: Assessment, Open date, Submission date, Peer-Review date: These highlight the different criteria and their respective dates.\n\n**Important Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Course:** Tools in Data Science\n*   **Institution:** IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras)\n*   **Assessments:**\n    *   ROE1: Remote Online Exam 1 (45 mins, open internet, Objective assessments)\n    *   P1: Take-home project 1 (open internet)\n    *   P2: Take-home project 2 (open internet)\n    *   GAA: Score in the best 4 of 7 weekly assignments (open internet, MCQs)\n    *   F: Final end-term exam (no internet, in-person, mandatory)\n*   **Dates:** The email specifies open, submission, and peer-review dates for each assessment.\n*   **Grading Scheme:** The email outlines the weighting of different assessment components for the final course score (T), including GAA, ROE1, P1, P2, and the final exam (F). Two formulas are given for T; this is because there is the possibility of two different weightings.\n*   **Peer Review:** Projects P1 and P2 have two components which include submissions and peer reviews with an 80:20 weightage.\n\nIn summary, the email provides important details about the course assessment components, grading criteria, and the requirements to be eligible to write the final exam and receive a grade. The highlights draw attention to the essential points related to eligibility and grade calculation.\n",

The hour hand points to the number 9, and the minute hand points to the number 12.  Small blue squares indicate the hours on the clock face.  The overall impression is a simple, decorative representation of the time 9:00.\n\n**No highlights are present in the image.** Therefore, there's no particular area being emphasized.\n",

I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn‚Äôt need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly.\nFILES\nThe data file sent to the api will always be in the requester‚Äôs local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?\nOr\nSometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this :  https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png\nThis link was take from GA2 Question 2\nHTML AND TABLE\nSome questions have html and tables. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.\nExample for string. Consider the table\n\n\n\n\nCol 1\nCol 2\n\n\n\n\nRow 1, Col1\nRow 1 Col 2\n\n\nRow 2, Col 1\nRow 2 Col 2\n\n\n\nWill this be something like this\n\"|Col 1| Col 2|\\n|-|-|\\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|\"\n\nor something like\n\"<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Col 1</th>\\n<th>Col 2</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\n\"\n\nHIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS\nIn one question, there were two tasks.\n\nFind the answer to the question\nEnable the disabled text block\n\nIn this question, what will the answer type be?\nShould it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block\nMORE THAN ONE FILE\nSome questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp and a table.\nIn this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this\ncurl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\\n  -F \"question=question text\" \\\n  -F \"file= Image file\" \\\n  -F \"file= table file/ string\" \n\nCORS HEADERS\nWill the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?",

      "image_description": "Here is a description of the image:\n\nThe image displays a programming task related to sending HTTP requests with the `httpie` Python package using the `uv run` command.\n\n**Key elements and their interpretations:**\n\n*   **`uv run --with httpie -- https [URL]`**:  This command installs the `httpie` package using the `uv run` command and sends an HTTPS request to a specified URL. The placeholders mean to input a URL where it is written.\n\n*   **`Send a HTTPS request to https://httpbin.org/get with the URL encoded parameter email set to 21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`**:  This is the specific task: send an HTTPS GET request to the `httpbin.org/get` endpoint, including the email address in the URL-encoded parameters. The `email` parameter is highlighted, indicating it's a crucial part of the request.\n\n*   **`What is the JSON output of the command?`**:  The task is to provide the JSON response from the server when the command is executed. It explicitly asks for the JSON body, excluding the headers.\n\n*   **JSON Output**: This seems to be the user's attempt to answer the question:\n\n    *   `{\"args\": {\"email\": \"21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\"}, \"headers\": {\"Accept\": \"*/*\", \"Accept-Encodir`\n\n*   **\"Check\" Button**: This indicates the presence of an interface where a user can submit their answer to be checked for correctness.\n\n**In Summary:** The image represents a programming exercise where the user is expected to use `httpie` to make an HTTP request with a specific URL and parameter, and then provide the JSON output received from the server. The highlighted elements draw attention to the key aspects of the task and the expected response format.",

      "image_description": "Here's a breakdown of the code snippet shown in the image:\n\n**Description:**\n\nThe image displays a Python interactive session (likely a Jupyter Notebook or iPython) demonstrating how to work with JSON data.  It shows the assignment of a string representation of a JSON object to a variable `jobj`, and then demonstrates the use of `json.loads()` to parse the string into a Python dictionary. Finally, it shows how to access a value from the parsed JSON object.\n\n**Key Code Snippets and their purpose**\n\n*   **`jobj = '{\"name\":\"jivraj\"}'`**: This line assigns a *string* that *looks* like JSON data to the variable `jobj`.\n*   **`json.loads(jobj)`**: This line uses the `json.loads()` function to parse the `jobj` string, converting it into a Python dictionary. Now `jobj` represents true json data that can be utilized as a dictionary.\n*   **`json.loads(jobj)['name']`**: This line does the same parsing, but it immediately accesses the value associated with the key `'name'` from the resulting dictionary.\n*   **`type(jobj)`**: This line shows that the variable `jobj`'s data type is `str` (string).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **The role of `json.loads()`:**  The key point is the use of `json.loads()`. Without it, `jobj` is just a string.  `json.loads()` transforms it into a proper Python dictionary, enabling you to access elements using dictionary-style indexing (e.g., `['name']`).\n\nIn essence, the code demonstrates a typical workflow: receiving JSON data as a string, parsing it into a usable Python dictionary, and then extracting specific information from that dictionary.",

It begins by defining a dictionary called `response` that contains an \"answer\" key holding a string representation of a JSON object.  This nested JSON structure includes \"args\" containing a \"challenge\" with the text \"How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?\".\n\nThe code then uses the `json` library to serialize the `response` dictionary into a JSON string using `json.dumps` with indentation for readability. This JSON string is then printed.\n\nNext, `json.loads` is used to parse the `send_response` JSON string, and then the 'answer' key is extracted and assigned to `tds_evaluator`.\n\nFinally, the code prints a string \"OH MY GOODNESS! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! THIS IS AMAZING!\", indicating a successful or desired outcome. The 0.0s beside the print statements is likely timing information indicating that those statements ran very quickly.",

The context of this task is to publish a webpage via GitHub Pages showcasing one's work.\n\n**Key Instructions/Parameters:**\n\n*   **Publish via GitHub Pages:** The primary instruction is to create a webpage using GitHub Pages.\n*   **Email Address Requirement:** It is essential to include the email address \"22f3000819@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\" within the HTML of the GitHub Pages site.\n*   **Email Obfuscation:** GitHub Pages uses Cloudflare, which obfuscates emails. Therefore, the email address should be wrapped in a specific HTML comment structure to prevent direct exposure.\n\n**Highlighted Parts and Why:**\n\n*   **\"GitHub Pages\"**: Highlighted in Blue to show that it is a clickable link and show how the work is supposed to be done\n*   **Email Address (22f3000819@ds.study.iitm.ac.in)**: Highlighted in Red to emphasize it's a crucial requirement. It needs to be present in the published page's HTML.\n*   **\"obfuscates emails\":** Highlighted to show that the email address is needed to be protected and not exposed, and to show what the next line means.\n*   **Email Wrapping Code (`<!--email_off-->22f3000819@ds.study.i`)**: Shows in the question itself what needs to be done with the email address.\n*   **GitHub Pages URL Format (`https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`)**: Gives you the format of how the user is supposed to provide an input\n*   **Cache Busting:** Informs the user how to make the changes get reflected immediately.\n\n**Important Parameters/Topics:**\n\n*   **GitHub Pages:** A platform for hosting static websites directly from a GitHub repository.\n*   **Cloudflare:** A content delivery network (CDN) that is used by GitHub Pages.\n*   **HTML:** The standard markup language for creating web pages.\n*   **Cache Busting:**  A technique to force browsers to load the latest version of a webpage by adding a query parameter (e.g., `?v=1`) to the URL.\n\n**Overall Task:**\n\nThe core goal is to deploy a webpage using GitHub Pages while ensuring a specific email address is included in the HTML source code but properly obfuscated to avoid spamming. The prompt also inquires about the user's GitHub Pages URL and provides instructions on how to handle caching issues.\n",

If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn‚Äôt even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..\nI have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2.

      "image_description": "Here's a precise description of the image, including the highlighted parts:\n\n**Overall Description:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a webpage related to a software product called \"UrbanRide.\" The page discusses the \"Impact\" of automating the extraction and processing of bounding box data. It lists four key benefits:\n\n*   Optimize Routing\n*   Improve Fleet Allocation\n*   Enhance Market Analysis\n*   Scale Operations\n\n**Highlighted Parts:**\n\n*   **Input Field: 38.566 (Highlighted in red):** This is a user input field where the user is asked to enter the minimum latitude of the bounding box for the city of Tianjin in China, using the Nominatim API. The red highlight indicates that the entered value (38.566) is incorrect.\n\n*   **Error Message (Highlighted in red):** Below the input field, there's an error message \"Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 2077.\" The red highlight reinforces that the user-provided value is causing an error. The error message suggests the user should verify the value using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) ID that ends with 2077.\n\n**Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Bounding Box Data:** A core concept, referring to geographical boundaries used to represent cities or regions.\n*   **Nominatim API:** A popular open-source geocoding API used to search for locations by name and obtain geographical coordinates.\n*   **Latitude/Longitude:** Key geographical parameters for defining a location. The question focuses specifically on the minimum latitude.\n*   **Tianjin, China:** The specific city being analyzed.\n*   **OpenStreetMap (OSM):** A collaborative, open-source map dataset, used as the basis for Nominatim.\n*   **Route Planning, Fleet Allocation, Market Analysis, Scalability:** Application areas where accurate bounding box data can have a significant impact, according to the initial bullet points.\n",

Weekly trends were calculated.\n*   **Analysis Steps:**\n    1.  Compared daily steps with previous weeks.\n    2.  Compared steps with friends to analyze trends.\n*   **Steps Walked Table:** Shows step counts for different days of the week, with Thursday highlighted as 10,000 steps, Monday as 8,500, and Friday as 9,600.\n*   **Code for Step Analysis:**  Indicates Python was used with the `pandas` library to analyze the step data. A list of days is used to create a Pandas DataFrame, and the `describe()` method is used for statistical summary.\n*   **Observations:** Highlights that the highest step count was recorded on Sunday.\n*   **Comparison with Friends:** Presents average daily step counts for Alice (10,500) and Bob (9,800).\n*   **Improvements:** Suggests ways to improve step count tracking, including increasing daily goals and using an advanced fitness tracker.\n*   **Reference:**  Includes a link to a healthline.com article on \"How Many Steps a Day?\".\n*   **Visualization:**  The last line says that there will be a visualization section.\n\n**Highlighted Parts and Why:**\n\n*   **Sunday:** This is highlighted to emphasize that it had the highest step count for the week.\n*   **Alice: 10,500 steps/day average:** This is highlighted to emphasize her high average daily step count.\n*   **Bob: 9,800 steps/day average:** This is highlighted to emphasize his average daily step count.\n*   **Increase daily goals:** This is highlighted as a key recommendation to improve step count tracking.\n\n**Overall, the image provides a summary of a step analysis project, including data collection methods, analytical techniques, key observations, and recommendations for improvement.**",

      "content": "@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini\nQuestions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday‚Äôs Session)\nRespected TDS Team,\nAs per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following @Saransh‚Äôs suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation.\n\n Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue\n\n\nGA3 Q8\n\nIssue: The question doesn‚Äôt mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.\n\n\n\nGA3 Q9\n\nIssue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.\nClarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?\n\n\n\nGA4 Q2 & Q10\n\nIssue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.\nReference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution\n\n\n\nOutput Formatting (Multiple Questions)\n\nIssue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added.\nNote: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {‚Äúanswer‚Äù: ‚Äúresult‚Äù}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.\n\n\n\nVercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions\n\nIssue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.\nClarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?\n\n\n\n\nDeployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday‚Äôs Session)\nPlease include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:\n\n\nPlatform Capability for GA Tasks\n\nWhich cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?\nNote: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.\n\n\n\nFile Upload Example via Platform API\n\nRequest: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.\nThis would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.\n\n\n\nGeneral Observations on GA1-5\nOutput Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.\n\n\n\nKindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.",

      "content": "@carlton , @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\n\nGA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages\n\n\n\nAs part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address 21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.\n\n\nTo automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page‚Äôs availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10‚Äì20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process‚Äîfrom initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live‚Äîtakes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.\n\n\nHowever, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly‚Äîbefore the GitHub Pages site is actually live‚Äîresulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a 502 Bad Gateway error, likely due to Azure‚Äôs request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform‚Äôs allowed response duration.\n\n\n\nGA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files\n\n\n\nA similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure‚Äôs execution time limit.\n\n\nMoreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.\n\n\nCurrently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.\nBelow Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.\nimage1854√ó493 55.9 KB",

I‚Äôd like to share a few reflections‚Äînot as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.\n\nOrganization & Structure:\nThe project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone‚Äîjust sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.\nDeployment & Portal Limitations:\nThere are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.\nTime Constraints:\nBalancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.\nSessions & Support:\nThe sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.\nDeployment Variability:\nEach GA‚Äôs questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.\nEffort Acknowledgment:\nI sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors‚Äîit‚Äôs clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it‚Äôs also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail‚Äîeven the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.\nFeasibility in the Given Timeline:\nEven for someone with a technical background, it‚Äôs difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn‚Äôt always feasible before the deadline.\n\n\nI genuinely hope someone is able to complete all 57 questions successfully‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to learn from their experience and solutions.\nAgain, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know‚ÄîI‚Äôm happy to edit or delete the post if needed.\nThank you for the learning opportunity",

I have developed a mini chatbot backend using vicky_server.py, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.\nHowever, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as ‚Äúquestion.pdf.‚Äù How can I effectively manage this problem?\nFurthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word ‚Äúcode‚Äù and executes first.py for GA1.\nThank you for the opportunity to work on this project!\nBest regards,\nvicky kumar\n@s.anand @carlton @Saransh_Saini\nmy model at Vicky kumar tds",

      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image, focusing on the key aspects and highlighted areas:\n\n**Description:**\n\nThe image shows Python code that parses a JSON string to extract a specific value. The code snippet imports the `json` library, defines a string variable `my_response` containing a JSON object with a key \"answer\" and value \"26272\". It then uses `json.loads()` to parse the JSON string into a Python dictionary, and finally, prints the value associated with the \"answer\" key.  The output \"26272\" is displayed below the code.\n\n**Highlighted Parts and Why:**\n\n*   `json.loads(my_response)[\"answer\"]`: This part is highlighted to emphasize how the data is being parsed and extracted. `json.loads()` converts the JSON string `my_response` into a Python dictionary. Square bracket notation `[\"answer\"]` is used to access the value associated with the \"answer\" key within the newly formed Python dictionary.\n\n**Important Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** This is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.\n*   **`json.loads()`:** This Python function is used to parse a JSON string and convert it into a Python dictionary.\n*   **Python Dictionaries:** The result of `json.loads()` is a Python dictionary, which allows you to access values using keys.\n*   **Data Extraction:** The code demonstrates how to extract specific data (in this case, the value associated with the key \"answer\") from a JSON string.\n*   **String Formatting/Escaping:**  The JSON string uses backslashes (`\\`) to escape the double quotes (`\"`) within the string, making it a valid Python string that can be properly interpreted as JSON.",

      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image, including the key elements and potential interpretations:\n\n**Overall Description:**\n\nThe image shows a Microsoft Azure webpage related to academic verification. The user is trying to verify their account for educational access.\n\n**Key Elements and Parameters:**\n\n*   **Microsoft Azure Header:** Identifies the platform as Microsoft Azure.\n*   **Email Address:** Visible in the top-right corner: \"23l2004705@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\"\n*   **Error Message:** \"Your email domain is not currently registered with us. You can choose another verification method.\" This suggests the email domain (@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) isn't recognized as belonging to an eligible academic institution.\n*   **\"Sign out\" Link:** Suggests the user is already logged in, but needs to complete verification.\n*   **\"Academic Verification\" Title:** Indicates the purpose of the page.\n*   **Instructional Text:** \"Start by entering your name as per the school records. Select your school's country and enter your school's name. Enter your date of birth as per the school records. The email address may be used to reach you if we have trouble verifying your application, so please enter your school provided email address.\" This outlines the required information for the academic verification process.\n\n**Highlights and Interpretation:**\n\n*   **Error Message:** The most significant highlight is the message about the unregistered email domain. It signifies a problem with the user's school domain being recognized by Microsoft for academic benefits/verification. The user will need to find another verification method or potentially contact support.\n*   **Academic Verification Instructions:** The instructions emphasize the importance of using information that matches school records, likely to prevent fraudulent applications. The mention of date of birth and school name reinforces this.\n*   **Email Address Request:**  The final sentence requesting the school-provided email address also emphasizes the need for authentication in this process.\n\n**Topics:**\n\n*   **Account Verification:** Specifically, academic account verification.\n*   **Microsoft Azure:** The cloud platform for which access is being sought.\n*   **Educational Access:** The purpose of the verification process.\n*   **User Interface:** The design and information presented on the webpage.\n*   **Error Handling:** How the system responds to unrecognized email domains.",

      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image, incorporating the highlighted parts and their significance:\n\n**Description:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of an \"Academic Verification\" form, likely part of an online application or registration process. The form is requesting personal information to verify the applicant's academic status.\n\n**Key elements of the form:**\n\n*   **Header:** \"Academic Verification\"\n*   **Introductory Text:** Explains the purpose of the form: to verify the applicant's name, school, and date of birth as per school records. It also mentions that the email address may be used if there is a problem with verification.\n*   **Fields:**\n    *   **First name:** Pre-filled with the name \"shashikumar.\"\n    *   **Last name:** Currently blank.\n        *   **Highlight:**  \"This field is required\" is displayed in red below the \"Last name\" field. This indicates that the last name field cannot be left empty.\n    *   **Country:** A dropdown menu pre-selected with \"India\".\n        *   **Note:**  Below the country selection is a message: \"If your country is not listed, the offer is not available in your region. Learn More\"\n    *   **School Name:** Field filled with  \"Indian Institute Of Technology Madras (Chennai, Tamil Nadu)\". It also mentions that the School name will help provide Microsoft with additional information for verification. If available, please enter it here.\n    *   **Date of Birth:** The field is left incomplete.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe form is designed to collect accurate student information for verification purposes. The \"Last name\" field being highlighted signifies the importance of providing a complete name for proper matching with school records. The form also addresses potential limitations based on country availability.",

      "image_description": "Here's a breakdown of the image content, the error, and the solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe image shows Python code demonstrating how to work with JSON objects using the `json` library.  The initial attempt to parse a Python dictionary (`my_response`) with `json.loads` results in a `TypeError`. The subsequent corrected code shows how to properly serialize a Python dictionary into a JSON string using `json.dumps` before parsing it with `json.loads`.\n\n**Problem and Error (Highlighted)**\n\n*   **Highlighted line:**  `print(json.loads(my_response)[\"answer\"])` in the first code block is highlighted, because this line is the source of the `TypeError`.\n*   **TypeError:** The `TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not dict` indicates that the `json.loads()` function expects a string (representing JSON data), bytes, or bytearray as input, not a Python dictionary directly.  The error occurs because `my_response` is a Python dictionary, not a JSON string.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe second code block demonstrates the correct approach:\n\n1.  **`json.dumps(my_response)`:** This converts the Python dictionary `my_response` into a JSON-formatted string.  The resulting string will be `{\"answer\": \"26272\"}`.\n2.  **`json.loads(my_response)`:** Now, `json.loads` receives a valid JSON string as input.  It parses this string into a Python dictionary.\n3.  **`[\"answer\"]`:**  This accesses the value associated with the key \"answer\" in the dictionary returned by `json.loads`, resulting in the output \"26272\".\n\n**Key Concepts**\n\n*   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**  A lightweight data-interchange format used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, or between different applications.\n*   **`json.loads()`:**  This Python function parses a JSON *string* and converts it into a Python dictionary.\n*   **`json.dumps()`:** This Python function converts a Python dictionary or other Python object into a JSON-formatted *string*.\n*   **Serialization/Deserialization:**  `json.dumps` is used for serialization (converting a Python object into a JSON string), and `json.loads` is used for deserialization (converting a JSON string into a Python object).\n",

This API accepts a CSV file and returns student data.  It allows filtering of student data by class using query parameters.\n\n**Highlighted Aspects and Significance:**\n\n*   **`POST /api/upload-csv`:** This indicates the HTTP method (POST) and the specific endpoint being tested. POST is generally used to create or update resources on the server.\n*   **\"Accept a CSV file and return student data. Optional class filters via query string: `/api?class=1A&class=1B`\":** Highlights that the API processes CSV files containing student information and that class filtering is possible via query parameters.\n*   **Parameters table:** Defines the available parameters: `class` (with value \"1A\") and `arrayString` (with value \"1B\").\n*   **Request body:** Uses `multipart/form-data` as the content type, which is suitable for uploading files (the CSV file in this case, named `foostopi.csv`). The file is specified as required.\n*   **Curl:** Displays a curl command that would execute the same API call from the command line. The highlighted part shows the URL with query parameters `class=1A&class=1B`.\n*   **Request URL:** The full URL used for the API request.\n*   **Server response:** A 200 OK HTTP status code is returned, indicating a successful request. The response body is a JSON array of \"students\" objects, each containing a \"studentId\" and \"class\" property, showing that the API successfully processed the CSV and returned student data.",

      "image_description": "Certainly! Here's a precise description of the image, including highlighted elements and their significance:\n\n**Image Description:**\n\nThe image presents a vibrant and futuristic cityscape, characterized by towering skyscrapers of varied designs, illuminated with bright neon accents of blue and pink. Flying vehicles, resembling sleek spaceships with glowing blue lights, traverse the sky. Below, multi-tiered elevated roadways weave through the city, showing light trails from passing vehicles.\n\n**Highlighted Elements and Significance:**\n\n*   **Neon Lights:** The extensive use of neon lighting (especially blue and pink) on the buildings and roads gives the city a cyberpunk aesthetic, suggesting advanced technology and a bustling nightlife. The neon lights also creates a focal point which gives emphasis on the buildings and roads in the cityscape.\n\n*   **Flying Vehicles:** These represent advanced transportation technology and further reinforce the futuristic theme.\n\n*   **Elevated Roadways:** These roadways with light trails represents continuous traffic and an efficient, multi-layered transportation system which contributes to a highly functional and densely populated urban environment.\n\n**Other Important Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Color Palette:** The image primarily uses shades of blue, pink, and hints of sunset colors in the background, which contributes to a dynamic and somewhat surreal mood.\n\n*   **Composition:** The high-angle perspective offers a broad overview of the city, while the dense arrangement of buildings conveys the idea of a densely populated, advanced urban center.\n\n*   **Overall Theme:** The image taps into themes of technological advancement, futuristic urban planning, and cyberpunk aesthetics, creating an impression of a world transformed by technology.",

The \"Allow selected ports\" radio button is selected. The asterisk denotes that this field is mandatory.\n*   **Select inbound ports:**\n    *   Dropdown: Currently selected to \"SSH (22)\", highlighted with a purple border.\n*   **Warning message:** Displayed in a shaded box. It highlights that allowing all IP addresses to access the virtual machine is only recommended for testing purposes and users should use Advanced controls in the Networking tab to limit inbound traffic to known IP addresses. This warning is likely highlighted to draw attention to the security implications of the current configuration, which exposes SSH (port 22) to all IP addresses.",

Write SQL to calculate it.\" This implies that the task requires formulating an SQL query to compute the total sales (units * price) for rows where the ticket type is \"Gold\" (case-insensitive).",

The response includes the request URL, server response code (200 OK), and a JSON formatted response body.\n\n**Details:**\n\n*   **`curl` Command:**\n    *   The command sends a `POST` request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`.\n    *   It sets the `accept` header to `application/json`.\n    *   It sets the `Content-Type` to `multipart/form-data`.\n    *   It sends a form field named `question` with the value \"ShopSmart is an online retail platform that places a high value on customer feedback. Each month, the company receives hundreds of comments.\"\n\n*   **Request URL:**\n    *   The request URL is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`\n\n*   **Server Response:**\n    *   The server returns a `200` status code, indicating a successful request.\n    *   The response body is a JSON object.\n\n*   **JSON Response Body:**\n    *   The JSON object contains a field named `\"answer\"`.\n    *   The value of the `\"answer\"` field is a string containing:\n        *   A description of a Python function that calculates cosine similarity between pairs of embeddings.\n        *   The Python code for the cosine similarity function and a `most_similar` function.\n        *   An example usage with some sample \"embeddings\" and their vector representations (lists of floating-point numbers).\n        *   One of embeddings has a value of `\"Shipping costs were too high.\"`\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n* The whole Response body is highlighted, This is probably done to draw attention to the function that is being returned by the API. The function is designed to find the most similar phrase pair based on cosine similarity of their embeddings and it gives an example usecase also.\n",

The \"Free\" badge is particularly relevant because it explains the limitations on inactivity.\n\n2.  **\"Your free instance will spin down with inactivity...\" message:** This message is displayed prominently (in a purple box) to warn the user about a limitation of the free tier. It directly impacts performance and user experience. The \"Upgrade now\" link provides a call to action to remove this limitation.\n\n3.  **\"In Progress\":** This highlights the current deployment status. It's important to know that the deployment is underway.\n\n4.  **\"Cancel deploy\":** Indicates a button to immediately cancel an ongoing deployment.\n\n**In summary,** the dashboard provides a snapshot of the project's status, configuration, and any limitations related to the chosen hosting plan (in this case, the free tier). The highlighting draws attention to key information and available actions.",

      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image, focusing on the key elements and their implications:\n\n**Description:**\n\nThe image is a cartoon depiction of a young man pleading. He has large, watery eyes (characteristic of an appeal for sympathy), blushed cheeks, and his hands are clasped together in a gesture of supplication. The word \"PLEASE!\" is highlighted in bold, bright pink and red, likely to emphasize the intensity and urgency of his request. Small, sweat-like droplets are present near his head, indicating nervousness or anxiety. His expression is one of vulnerability and hopefulness.\n\n**Highlighted Elements and Why:**\n\n*   **\"PLEASE!\" (Highlighted in Pink and Red):** This is the most crucial element, as it directly conveys the purpose of the image. The bright colors draw attention to the plea, reinforcing the message of the character's desperation or strong desire.\n\n*   **Large, Watery Eyes:** This is a common visual trope used to evoke empathy and make the character appear more vulnerable. They are exaggerated to enhance the emotional impact.\n\n*   **Blushed Cheeks:** This element often symbolizes shyness, embarrassment, or intense emotion, further adding to the character's perceived vulnerability.\n\n*   **Hands Clasped Together:** The clasped hands is a traditional gesture of prayer, begging, or pleading. It reinforces the character's request and conveys humility.\n\n**Important Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Emotional Appeal:** The image is designed to evoke an emotional response, specifically sympathy or a willingness to help the character.\n\n*   **Cartoon Style:** The cartoonish style makes the image relatable and less threatening, allowing it to be used in a wider range of contexts.\n\n*   **Nonverbal Communication:** The character's body language (clasped hands, facial expression) is vital in conveying the message, as it amplifies the written plea.\n\n*   **Context Dependency:** The effectiveness of the image relies on the context in which it is used. Its meaning depends on what the person is pleading for.\n",

The key pieces of information provided are:\n\n*   **Error Status:** 500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR - This is the main error code.\n*   **Error Code:** FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED - this indicates a problem in running a function.\n*   **Error ID:** A unique alphanumeric identifier (`bom1::48ghr-1743430791127-d99a1b77819a`) to help in debugging and tracing the error.\n*   **Connection and Vercel Status:** The image also indicates that the user's internet connection and the Vercel platform itself are working correctly, narrowing the problem down to the function itself.\n*   **Troubleshooting Suggestions:** There's guidance for both website visitors (contact the owner) and website owners (learn how to fix the error, check logs).\n\nThe \"This Serverless Function has crashed\" is highlighted (indicated by pink color of the line) because it's the immediate cause of the issue for the user to know that serverless function that they are trying to use is failing. The \"learn how to fix the error\" and \"check the logs\" sections is in blue that it is important for owner as this has all the information to debug and fix the function.",

The flag waves against a backdrop of a blue sky with scattered white clouds. A wooden mast is visible on the left side of the image, suggesting the flag is hoisted on a ship. The straw hat is highlighted because it symbolizes the crew's captain, Monkey D. Luffy, who is almost always seen wearing it.",

      "content": "I reuesting to all my teachers @s.anand, @carlton, @Jivraj, @Saransh_Saini please reply me.\nWhat is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don‚Äôt have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don‚Äôt have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don‚Äôt think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn‚Äôt provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don‚Äôt have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber‚Äôs Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India‚Äôs top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don‚Äôt ask anything.\nSome students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won‚Äôt be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don‚Äôt ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI‚Äôs or read whatever and wherever you want to read.\nIt is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.\nThankyou to all my respected ‚ÄòThe Great Teachers‚Äô.",

      "content": "Dear Shahzada,\nYou joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)\nThe first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nWhat is this going on? Is it joking?\n\n\nI am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nOur teachers don‚Äôt have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?\n\n\nWe have made several hours of videos on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nI already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.\n\n\nNot sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nThey explained what should be your approach? How to make project?\n\n\nYes these were explained if you\n\neither took part in any live session or\nwatched the recorded video\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nAnd here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?\n\n\nI am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nIt is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.\n\n\nProject 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:\nCreate a server api that receives a request.\nThe request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.\nThe response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.\nMultiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nEven they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?\n\n\nSince this is your first post, you‚Äôve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.\nIf you want solutions, there are several options:\n\nAsk for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)\nCollaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)\nJoin live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)\nWatch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nThey don‚Äôt have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.\n\n\nThis is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.\nThe biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs‚Ä¶ with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nAre we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India‚Äôs top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.\n\n\nIf you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.\nBut feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.\nWhat are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.\nI absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nThey only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don‚Äôt ask anything.\n\n\nReading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.  Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.\nNow is a good time to start.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nSome students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won‚Äôt be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \"\n\n\nThat is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nI want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?\n\n\nThey have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.\nLuckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nThe first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.\n\n\nIf you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nIn project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.\n\n\nAnand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?\nAlso if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.\nBut validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.\nYou can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nIt is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.\nThankyou to all my respected ‚ÄòThe Great Teachers‚Äô.\n\n\nI am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither respect nor kindness is evident in your post.\nBut thank you for your feedback.\nOne final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.\nAnd when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.\nKind regards,\nTDS team",

      "content": "Hi, I have a few things to say\nMy background :\nI have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.\nMy Initial Disappointments with this Course\nIn one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):\n\nThe video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.\n\n\nHere, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn‚Äôt like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph\nROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.\nThere are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.\n\nWhy did I fail?\nLast Term\nI dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn‚Äôt practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.\nThis term.\nI made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn‚Äôt allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn‚Äôt submit both the projects.\nIn both the terms I didn‚Äôt collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn‚Äôt earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.\nMe Understanding about the Course Now\nThis one line changed my view about ROE.\n\n\n\nOn another topic\n\nWhat does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning.\n\n\nI am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don‚Äôt know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.\nI scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.\nNow I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.\nIn MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing SKLearn. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.\nThis course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an implicit way.\nThis is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.\nI have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks\nI have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.\nI am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.\nFrom the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn‚Äôt do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn‚Äôt cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.\nSince this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.\nThanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj  and @Saransh_Saini\n\nJust two suggestions\n\n\nI feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.\nWhile introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.\n",

The \"Parameters\" section indicates \"No parameters\" are defined directly.  The \"Request body\" is marked as `required`. The content type is set to `multipart/form-data`.\n\nThe form includes two fields:\n\n*   **question:** This is a required text field (indicated by the red asterisk), and it currently contains the string \"Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single\". The `required` attribute highlights that the field needs a valid input before the request can be executed.\n\n*   **file:** This is a file upload field. A file named \"q-multi-cursor.json.txt\" has already been chosen.  The data type is shown as  `string | null | binary`, meaning the file can be sent as a string, null, or as a binary file. There is also an option to send an empty value.\n\nBelow these input fields are \"Execute\" and \"Clear\" buttons for processing the request. The \"Responses\" section and \"Curl\" section indicates to receive responses data.\n\nAt the top of the form are \"Cancel\" (highlighted in red) and \"Reset\" buttons, used to abort the request submission or restore the form settings. The red highlighting draws attention to the potentially destructive action of canceling.\n",

While my project‚Äôs size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.\nCould you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue?

      "content": ":\n\n From Problem to Platform: Building ‚ÄúVicky‚Äù ‚Äì A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras\n Project Demo Website: https://app.algsoch.tech\nDuring our college course Tool for Data Science (TDS) at IIT Madras, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API.\n The Mission:\nCreate a tool that behaves like a chatbot, accepts user queries (text or file-based) via web or API, processes them intelligently, executes the appropriate code, and returns accurate results‚Äîlike a real data science assistant.\n\n The Journey: From Fails to Final\nAt first, the natural choice was to try LLM agents‚Äîthey sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. \nThen I thought‚Äîwhat if I manually mapped questions and answers using a static JSON structure? That quickly broke when users passed different parameters, different files, or queried in non-standard formats like ‚Äúcode -s‚Äù or ‚Äúcode -v‚Äù.\nThe next idea: write individual Python scripts per question from our Graded Assignments (GA1‚ÄìGA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. \n\n The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping\nAfter multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:\n Centralized engine in vicky_server.py\n Uses regex-based pattern matching to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution\n Each solution is a structured Python function like ga1_first_solution(query=None)\n Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more\n Acts like a mini compiler for data science tools\n\n Presenting Vicky ‚Äì The Mini Chatbot for TDS \nVicky is a smart, modular chatbot built specifically for Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras. It‚Äôs packed with real functionality‚Äînot just templates.\nKey Features:\n Graded Assignment Solver\nHandles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:\n\ncode -s / code -v ‚Üí VS terminal commands\nCreate FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching\nGitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup\nData cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression\n\n File Upload with Query Matching\nUsers can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.\n HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder\n\nView any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy\nUpload Base64 string ‚Üí Get original image back\n\n Webhooks Integration\n\nLive notifications via Discord & Slack whenever /api endpoints are accessed\nMonitors server status (online/offline) and sends real-time updates\n\n LLM Download + Auto Tunneling\n\nDownloads LLaMA models\nDynamically finds available ports\nCreates and exposes tunneled endpoints\n\n Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech\n\nAsk any TDS question\nUpload and query with files\nImage decoder\nGraded assignment slider navigation\nHTML viewer\nAPI health status\n\n\n Built With:\n\nFastAPI for blazing fast APIs\nRegex & Pattern Matching for dynamic input detection\nGitHub Copilot + my Python debugging and architectural thinking\nFull webhook and status monitoring system\nModular backend (vicky_server.py) and web frontend (vicky_app.py)\n\nI want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I‚Äôve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won‚Äôt replace our jobs‚Äîespecially for those who understand programming‚Äîthey will create new job opportunities instead.\nNow I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project",

      "content": "Dear Sir,\nI would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.\nI hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications.\nThank you for your understanding",

During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to @Saransh_Saini.\nIt seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.\nWe just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.\nWe hope this won‚Äôt be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.\nThank you\nLakshay",

      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image, focusing on precision and key details:\n\n**Image Description:**\n\nThe image shows a terminal window displaying a series of log entries. These logs are generated by a Python script named \"TDS\" (likely an application or service). Each line contains the timestamp, the script name, its process ID (79249), the log level (INFO or WARNING), the IP address and port of the client making the request, the HTTP method (GET, POST, or PROPFIND), the requested path, the HTTP protocol version, and the HTTP status code (200 OK, 404 Not Found, or 405 Method Not Allowed).  The output shows attempts to access various files and directories, including common configuration files (.env, .git/config), potentially revealing vulnerabilities. A WARNING message indicates an \"Invalid HTTP request received.\"\n\n**Key Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Timestamps:** Precise dates and times of each log entry.\n*   **Script/Process:** `TDS python[79249]` indicates the source of the logs.\n*   **Log Level:**  `INFO` for informational messages, `WARNING` highlights a potential issue.\n*   **IP Addresses & Ports:**  Source of HTTP requests to the server.\n*   **HTTP Methods:** GET (retrieval), POST (submission), PROPFIND (WebDAV property retrieval - often used for sensitive file probing).\n*   **Requested Paths:**  Files and directories being accessed, indicating possible exploit attempts.\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:**\n\n    *   `200 OK`:  Request was successful.\n    *   `404 Not Found`: Resource not found. This is a frequent response when probing for non-existent files.\n    *   `405 Method Not Allowed`:  The HTTP method is not permitted for the requested resource.\n*   **HTTP Protocol Version:**  HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 are used.\n*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** The logs indicate potential automated vulnerability scans attempting to find sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, `.git/config`, `/actuator/health`) or exploit WebDAV (PROPFIND).\n*   **Login Attempt:** POST request to `/logincheck` suggests authentication activity, potentially related to brute-forcing or other login-related attacks.\n\n**Why the potential emphasis/highlight (although not explicitly highlighted):**\n\nThe prevalence of 404 errors when requesting files like `.env` and `.git/config` is noteworthy. These files often contain sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, etc.).  Also, the PROPFIND requests are important because they could be looking for a WebDav vulnerabilites\n\nIn summary, the image shows server logs that indicate possible security probing and attempts to access sensitive information. The mix of HTTP status codes and file requests provides insight into the types of attacks being attempted.",

      "image_description": "Here's a precise description of the image, focusing on the key details and potential reasons for highlighting:\n\n**Image Description:**\n\nThe image displays a console or terminal output, likely from a web server or application. The output consists of a series of log messages, categorized as either \"INFO\" or \"WARNING\".\n\n*   **Log Messages:** The \"INFO\" messages detail HTTP GET and POST requests made to the server. They show the IP address and port of the client making the request, the HTTP method (GET or POST), the requested URL path, the HTTP version (e.g., HTTP/1.1), and a \"404 Not Found\" status code. This indicates that the server could not find the requested resources at those URLs. Many requests seem to be targeting common web application login pages (e.g., `/login.html`, `/admin/index.html`).\n\n*   **\"WARNING\" Messages:**  These indicate \"Invalid HTTP request received\". This often means the server received a request that didn't conform to the HTTP protocol in some way, preventing proper processing.\n\n*   **Shutdown Sequence:** The end of the log shows the server \"Shutting down\", \"Waiting for application shutdown\", \"Application shutdown complete\", and then a final message: \"Finished server process [1320]\".\n\n**Why are parts highlighted (assuming highlighting based on the context of seeking a description):**\n\n*   **IP Addresses:** The IP addresses are likely being highlighted to show source that is making HTTP requests. In particular, the numerous 404 errors and probes for common login pages may indicate scanning or attempts to find vulnerabilities. The IP addresses from which the invalid HTTP requests originate could also be of interest.\n*   **URL Paths:** The various URL paths being requested (e.g., `/admin/index.html`, `/login.jsp`, `/.env.bak`, `/hudson`) are highlighted because they are common targets of automated vulnerability scanners or attackers. Searching for `/admin/index.html` indicates a possible brute force admin panel attack. Also `/.env.bak` is highlighted because it is a target of information disclosure attacks. If exposed, the contents of the `.env` file may reveal confidential application configurations or internal server settings and credentials.\n\n*   **\"404 Not Found\" Status Code:**  This status code is significant because it points to the failure of numerous requests, potentially signaling a misconfigured server, broken links, or, as mentioned above, attempts to find vulnerabilities that don't exist.\n\n*   **\"WARNING\" messages:** An invalid request could indicate a bug within server.\n\n**Important Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** The \"404 Not Found\" status is a core element.\n*   **URL Enumeration/Scanning:** The repeated requests for common administrative and login pages are characteristic of automated scanners or vulnerability probing.\n*   **Server Shutdown:** The shutdown sequence is important to understand the state of the application.\n*   **Log Analysis:**  This is a log extract. Examining it provides insight into server activity, potential security threats, and application behavior.\n*   **IP Address Tracking:** Monitoring the IP addresses that are generating errors or suspicious requests can help identify malicious activity or configuration issues.\n",

      "image_description": "Here's a precise description of the image:\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a terminal window, likely from a Linux or Unix-like operating system. It shows log entries from a Python application named \"TDS,\" running with process ID 79249.\n\n**Key Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Log Entries:** Each line represents a log entry. The format generally follows:\n    *   `Date Time`: Timestamp of the log event.\n    *   `Application Name`: \"TDS python\" indicates the application name and the programming language.\n    *   `Process ID`: `[79249]` identifies the process generating the log.\n    *   `Log Level`: \"INFO\" signifies an informational message (as opposed to WARNING, ERROR, etc.).\n    *   `IP Address and Port`: `103.158.43.17:0` is the IP address and port number associated with the network connection related to the event.\n    *   `HTTP Request`:  Shows the type of HTTP request, the endpoint, and the HTTP protocol used.\n    *   `HTTP Status Code`: \"200 OK\" indicates a successful HTTP request.\n\n*   **Network Activity:** The log entries suggest the application is handling HTTP requests. It is receiving a mix of `GET` requests for `/favicon.ico` and `POST` requests to `/api`.\n\n*   **Highlighted IP Address:** The IP address `103.158.43.17:0` is highlighted in red. This likely indicates that it is of particular interest, possibly because it is an external IP or because of some monitoring rule. It might be a target for investigation, potential source of traffic, or just a specific host to keep an eye on.\n\n*   **User and Host:** The bottom line shows the current user and hostname: `azureuser@TDS:~$`. This indicates the user \"azureuser\" is logged into a host named \"TDS\" in their home directory.\n\nIn essence, the image provides a snapshot of server-side logging activity, showing incoming HTTP requests and their responses. The highlighting draws attention to a specific IP address involved in these requests.",

      "image_description": "Here's a concise description of the image, including highlighted areas and their significance:\n\n**Overall Description:**\n\nThe image displays a Postman API client interface. A POST request is being constructed to the endpoint `4.213.61.248:8080/api`. The request body is configured as `form-data` which has one key-value pair. The key `question` has the value `what is output of -s?`.\n\n**Key Parameters & Topics:**\n\n*   **API Endpoint:** `4.213.61.248:8080/api` - The URL to which the request is being sent.\n*   **HTTP Method:** `POST` - Indicates that the client is sending data to the server.\n*   **Request Body:**\n    *   `form-data`:  The selected format for sending data.\n    *   `question`:  The key parameter in the request.\n    *   `what is output of -s?`: The value associated with the 'question' key. It suggests that the API is designed to answer a particular question.\n*   **Response:**\n    *   `200 OK`: The HTTP status code indicates a successful response from the server.\n    *   `5.00 s`: Time it took for the request to be processed.\n    *   `2.08 KB`:  The size of the response data.\n    *   The response data is a JSON object containing one key called `\"answer\"`. The value is a very long string providing information about the environment that ran the API.\n\n**Highlights & Significance:**\n\n*   **`Body` tab selected:** Emphasizes that the user is configuring or viewing the request body.  This is important because the request's parameters are defined in the body.\n*   **`form-data`:** Indicates that the data is being sent in a format suitable for submitting forms, often used for sending simple key-value pairs. The \"question\" key in the request body is constructed as form data.\n*   **`what is output of -s?`:** This is the crucial part of the request because it represents the query or request being sent to the API. It is the parameter being provided for the API to process and answer.\n*   **`\"answer\"` in response body:** Indicates the start of the response body in JSON format. Since the question parameter is `what is output of -s?` it indicates that a similar question may have been answered using this API.\n*   **`200 OK` status code:**  Confirms that the request was successful, and the server processed it without errors.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts an API request being formulated in Postman, sending a specific question, and receiving a successful response containing information about the environment in which the API was executed. The user is focused on the structure of the request body.",

      "image_description": "Here's a precise description of the image:\n\n**Content:**\n\nThe image is a close-up shot of a laptop screen displaying a terminal window. The terminal output shows a log of activity related to a \"data science tool,\" likely involving natural language processing or question answering. The tool appears to be processing a series of questions and using Python scripts.\n\n**Key Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **File Paths:** Several Python files are mentioned (e.g., `third.py`, `second.py`, `eighteenth.py`, `sixth.py`, `seventh.py`) located within the `E://data science tool` directory.\n*   **Scores:** Each question processed seems to be associated with a \"score\" value (e.g., 8.30, 12.90, 5.90, 7.70, 14.50), which likely represents the confidence or relevance of the answer provided.\n*   **API Calls:** The output shows \"POST /ask HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK, indicating that the tool is making HTTP POST requests to an \"/ask\" endpoint, receiving successful responses.\n*   **Question Processing:** The `tds_app - INFO - Processing question:` lines show example questions being processed, such as \"LexiSolve Inc. is a startup that delivers a conv,\" \"There is a tickets table in a SQLite database that,\" \"Search using the Hacker News RSS API,\" and \"As a data analyst at DataSure Technologies, you ha...\"\n*   **Data Source:** One question references a SQLite database, indicating that the tool is potentially interacting with structured data.\n\n**Highlighted Elements:**\n\nThere are no elements that appear to be intentionally highlighted by the use of different colored text. However, the format of the output, with the \"score\" values and question text, could be considered implicitly highlighted as the key data points.\n\n**Explanation of Potential Highlights:**\n\n*   **Scores:** These are essential because they show how well the tool understands and answers the given questions.\n*   **Questions:** These are key as they illustrate the type of questions the data science tool is designed to handle and the contexts it can operate in.\n\n**Other Information:**\n\n*   The terminal tabs include \"DEBUG CONSOLE,\" \"TERMINAL,\" \"PORTS,\" \"QUERY RESULTS (PREVIEW),\" and \"COMMENTS.\"\n*   The timestamp \"06/04/2025 22:40\" is present.\n*   The device used is a \"REDMI NOTE 12\" based on a visible watermark.\n*   The image appears to be taken of a laptop screen, possibly with a cell phone.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe image showcases a data science tool running in a terminal window, processing a series of questions related to data analysis, database interaction, and accessing external APIs. The tool assigns scores to the questions, and uses HTTP requests for interaction. The Python scripts are stored in the path \"E://data science tool\".\n",

I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format ‚Äúhttps://‚Ä¶/api/‚Äù and allows only POST requests.\n\nThe app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response\nWhen POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests\na. http://‚Ä¶/api/ ‚Üí resulted in 302 response\nb. https://‚Ä¶/api  ‚Üí resulted in a 307\nwhereas the url I gave was of the format ‚Äúhttps://‚Ä¶/api/‚Äù\n\nThe logs from Cloud Run\nimage982√ó552 133 KB\nAs you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with ‚Äú/api‚Äù instead of ‚Äú/api/‚Äù, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).\nimage831√ó645 41.7 KB\nI request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.\nThank you.\nRegards,\nShivaditya",

      "image_description": "Here's a precise description of the image, addressing highlighted parts and key parameters:\n\n**Image Description:**\n\nThe image displays a log or network activity capture from a web application, likely a debugging or monitoring tool.  The log entries are time-stamped, spanning from \"2025-04-05 23:51:12.872\" to \"2025-04-06 00:14:41.329\".  Each line shows a log entry with information about HTTP requests made to an API endpoint.\n\n**Key Parameters & Topics:**\n\n*   **Timestamp:**  Indicates the exact time of each event.\n*   **INFO:** Log level\n*   **IP Address and Port:** (e.g., `169.254.169.126:49510`): Represents the client IP address and port from which the request originated.\n*   **HTTP Method:** (e.g., `POST`, `GET`):  Specifies the type of HTTP request being made.\n*   **Request Path:** (\"/api\"): The endpoint being accessed.\n*   **HTTP Version:** (e.g., `HTTP/1.1`): The version of the HTTP protocol used.\n*   **Status Code:** (e.g., `307`, `302`, `405`, `200`):  Indicates the server's response to the request.\n*   **Response Code Definitions:**\n\n    *   `200 OK`: The request was successful. (One instance at the end, likely the desired outcome)\n    *   `302 Found`: Temporary redirection; the resource has moved temporarily to a different URI.\n    *   `307 Temporary Redirect`: The resource resides temporarily under a different URI and the user agent MUST NOT change the request method if it performs an automatic redirection to that URI.\n    *   `405 Method Not Allowed`: The method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the resource identified by the Request-URI.\n*   **Data Size:** (e.g., `140 B`, `156 B`):  The size of the data transferred.\n*   **Response Time:** (e.g., `0 ms`, `1 ms`, `2 ms`, `509 ms`): The time taken for the server to respond.\n*   **Client:** (e.g., `python-reque`, `python-httpx`): Indicates the client library used to make the request.\n*   **URL:** The full URL being accessed, including the domain `tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app`.\n\n**Highlighted Parts and Significance:**\n\n*   **Status Codes 405 \"Method Not Allowed\"**:  The highlighted lines with the `405` status code indicate errors where the client is attempting to use an HTTP method (likely `GET`) that is not permitted for the `/api` endpoint. This suggests a potential configuration issue or incorrect API usage.\n*   **Status Codes 302, 307 \"Temporary Redirect\"**: These indicate the server is redirecting the client to a different URL for the resource. This might be part of a login process, routing scheme, or versioning strategy.\n*  **Status code 200 OK**: The last line in the log is highlighted, indicating a successful request (status code 200). This is in contrast to the other errors and redirect codes.\n\n**Overall Interpretation:**\n\nThe log suggests potential issues with API usage, particularly with the incorrect use of the `GET` method on the `/api` endpoint, resulting in `405` errors. There are also indications of redirects. The final line is successful request. It's a record of HTTP interactions with a server, showing a mixture of information, errors, and redirection activities.\n",

And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.\nThis is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)",

It shows logs related to a function invocation, along with details of the serverless function's execution and deployment.\n\n**Key Elements & Highlights:**\n\n*   **Log Entries:** The left side panel shows log entries, with timestamps and messages.\n    *   **Highlight: \"Failed to trigger workflow: 401\"**: This error message is highlighted with a red 'X', indicating a problem authenticating or accessing a resource (due to \"Bad credentials\"). This is important because it signals a critical issue in the application's workflow.\n*   **Function Invocation Details (Right Side Panel):**\n    *   **Highlight: \"Gateway Timeout 504\"**: Indicates a server-side error, where a gateway/proxy server didn't receive a timely response from the upstream server (the function being invoked). It means the server took to long to return the data. This is marked because it represents a failure or performance bottleneck.\n    *   **Route:** /main.py (the file being executed)\n    *   **Location:** Washington, D.C., USA (iad1) indicating the server location where the function runs.\n    *   **Runtime:** Python 3.12\n    *   **Execution Duration:** 10s / 10s - The function reached its maximum allowed execution time (10 seconds), likely contributing to the Gateway Timeout.\n    *   **Memory Used:** 214 MB / 1024 MB, This shows memory allocation details\n    *   **Status:** \"Response finished,\" even though there's a 504 error, implying a response was *eventually* returned, possibly after the timeout.\n*   **Deployment Information:**\n    *   **Deployment ID:** dpl\\_EFXAUNYSadoksLSimpbQCo5jo (a unique identifier)\n    *   **Environment:** production\n*   **Firewall: Allowed** This ensures that the firewall is properly setup\n",

I sincerely apologize for the confusion, and I‚Äôd be truly grateful for your support and understanding.\nThank you so much for your time and consideration.\nWarm regards,\nPratyush Pulak Nishhank",

      "image_description": "Here's a concise description of the image:\n\n*   **Content:** The image features a white, stylized \"F\" or lightning bolt shape set against a teal-colored circle.\n*   **Stylization:** The \"F\" is angular and modern, resembling a simplified lightning bolt, and likely a logo.\n*   **Color:** Teal and white have high contrast, making the logo easily visible. Teal represents growth, freshness, and wealth. The white bolt represents purity, cleanliness, and safety.\n*   **Parameters:** The logo is vector-based, meaning it can be scaled without losing quality.\n*   **Topics:** The image relates to branding, logo design, and potentially topics like energy, technology, or innovation, depending on the context of its use.",

It's imperative that learners turn these back on.\n\n**Other Important Information:**\n\n*   The email apologizes for any inconvenience caused by ongoing evaluations.\n*   The email mentions that the team is aware that students are using up credits on Azure and other platforms to keep evaluations running and aims to complete evaluations quickly.\n*   The email states that recipients will be informed when evaluations are complete.\n*   The email also includes a disclaimer stating \"Do NOT reply to this email.\" and encourages students to contact the course team via Discourse for assistance.\n*   The email is signed \"Kind regards, TDS Team\".\n*   There are unsubscribe, reply and forward buttons at the bottom.\n\n**Overall Message:**\n\nThe email is a critical announcement concerning Project 2 evaluations, urging learners to keep their servers up and running for ongoing checks.

      "image_description": "Here's a precise description of the image, including highlighted parts and their significance:\n\n**Overall Image Description:**\n\nThe image shows a screenshot of a Google Colab notebook (Untitled79.ipynb) displayed on a computer screen. The screen appears to have cracks.  The notebook contains Python code related to processing data from a ZIP file. The notebook also has a reCaptcha error at the top.\n\n**Key Parameters & Topics:**\n\n*   **Google Colab:** The image is of a Google Colab notebook, indicating that the code is likely running in a cloud-based environment.\n*   **Python Code:** The code snippet is written in Python.\n*   **Data Processing Task:** The core of the code focuses on downloading a ZIP file, extracting data from it, processing the data, and calculating a sum based on specific criteria.\n*   **File Encodings:** The task involves handling files with different encodings (CP-1252, UTF-8, UTF-16), a common issue in data processing that requires careful attention to avoid errors.\n*   **Data Structure:** The data in the files is structured in two columns: \"symbol\" and \"value\".\n*   **API Interaction:** The code makes a `requests.post` call, suggesting interaction with an API endpoint to send data and receive a response.\n*   **Response Handling:** The code prints the status code and text of the API response.\n*   **Answer:** The response includes the \"answer\" which is 39961\n\n**Highlighted Parts and Why:**\n\n*   **`url = \"https://tds-project-2-ruby.vercel.app/api/\"`**: This line defines the API endpoint where the data will be sent.  It's highlighted because it shows the destination of the data processing task.\n*   **`'file': open(r'q-unicode-data.zip', 'rb')`**: This part is highlighted since it shows the name of the zipped file and also tells us that the file is opened in a read binary format\n*   **`data = {` ... `}`**: This section defines the data payload sent to the API. The `question` explains the data processing requirements. The highlights call attention to the instructions and specifics of the task.\n*   **`response = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)`**:  This shows the POST request to the URL with the given files and data\n*   **`print(response.status_code)` and `print(response.text)`:** These lines are highlighted because they show how the script retrieves the result from the API. `response.status_code` shows the status of the request and `response.text` show the actual API response.\n*   **`200`**: This shows the status code of the request. It also tells us that the API request was successful.\n*   **`[\"answer\":39961)`:**: This tells us that after processing the data the answer is 39961\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe image depicts a Python script in a Colab notebook that downloads and processes data from a ZIP file with different character encodings. It sends this data to an API endpoint and displays the result, which is 39961. The highlighted sections are significant as they define the endpoint, request parameters, instructions, and the data retrieval and output. The presence of reCaptcha error suggests there may be issues with the Colab environment or internet connection.\n",

      "image_description": "Here's a precise description of the image, taking into account the important parameters and topics visible:\n\n**Description:**\n\nThe image shows a screenshot of a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) interface, specifically the \"Logs\" section of a \"Cloud Run\" service. The service is named \"tllprojectshiva.\"  The screenshot displays a list of log entries.\n\n**Key Elements & Parameters:**\n\n*   **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** The cloud computing platform being used.\n*   **Cloud Run:** The service within GCP that is running the application.  Cloud Run allows users to deploy containerized applications.\n*   **Logs:** The focus of the screenshot. Log entries are essential for debugging, monitoring, and auditing applications.\n*   **Log entries:** The rows of text show individual log events.  Each entry contains:\n    *   **Timestamp:**  The date and time of the log event (e.g., \"2023-04-15 17:16:55.222\").\n    *   **Severity:**  Indicates the importance or urgency of the log message (e.g., \"INFO\", \"DEFAULT\").\n    *   **Message:**  The actual log data.  These messages vary, but examples include:\n        *   \"Processing query for list.\"\n        *   \"Start Server server.listen.\"\n        *   \"GET was called...\". (indicating a request).\n        *   \"GET /API/Method/item/ben/.... \". (Showing a specific API endpoint request).\n        *   URLs, likely related to API endpoints.\n\n*   **Filtering/Search:** The \"Search all fields and values...\" bar suggests that the user can filter or search through the logs.\n\n**Interpretation**\nThe image shows activity within the Cloud Run service, likely triggered by user interactions or automated processes. The logs provide insights into how the application is behaving, including requests being made, server startup messages, and other diagnostic information. They can be used to track usage patterns and identify errors in the deployed application.",

The output lists each IP address followed by its accessed endpoint (always `/api/`) and the number of times it accessed that endpoint. Finally, it reports the total number of `/api/` endpoint calls (262) and the number of IPs accessing `/api/` (5).\n",

This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both Podman and Linux environments.\nUpon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on Railway and submitted that link as well.\nIf possible, I kindly request either of the following:\n\nRe-evaluation using the Railway link I provided, or\nRe-evaluation using the Render link, with allowance for the 50‚Äì60 second activation time.\n\nYour consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.\nThank you for your support and guidance.",

      "image_description": "Here's a breakdown of the image content:\n\n**Overall Description:**\n\nThe image shows Python code interacting with a FastAPI server. It's a script designed to send a question to the server along with a CSV file, and then receive an SQL query back as a response. The code uses the `requests` library to make a POST request to the FastAPI server.\n\n**Key Parameters & Topics:**\n\n*   **`requests` Library:**  The code imports the `requests` library, which is essential for making HTTP requests in Python.\n*   **FastAPI Server:** The code interacts with a FastAPI server at `http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2`. The URL is defined in the `url` variable.\n*   **HTTP POST Request:** The `requests.post()` function is used to send a POST request to the FastAPI server. POST requests are commonly used to send data to a server.\n*   **Data Payload:** The `data` dictionary contains the question that's being sent to the server.  The question is: *\"What is the total sales of all the items in the \"Gold\" ticket type? Write SQL to c...\"*.  It's designed to elicit an SQL query from the server.\n*   **File Upload:** The `files` dictionary is used to upload a CSV file (`q-fastapi.csv`) along with the request. The file is opened in binary read mode (`\"rb\"`) and its content type is specified as `\"text/plain\"`.\n*   **Response Handling:** The `response` variable stores the response from the server.\n*   **SQL Query Generation:** The expected response from the server is an SQL query.\n*   **File Path:** The file path `\"C:/Users/suneh/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv\"` is given\n\n**Terminal Output (PowerShell):**\n\n*   **Execution:** The command `python burima.py` executes the Python script.\n*   **Status Code:** The \"Status Code: 200\" indicates that the HTTP request was successful.\n*   **Response JSON:** The \"Response JSON\" shows the server's response, which is a JSON object containing the key `\"answer\"` and value: `\"SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER (TRIM(type)) = 'gold';\"`\" This is the generated SQL query.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe Python script sends a question related to sales of \"Gold\" tickets along with a CSV file to the FastAPI server. The server processes this information and returns an SQL query designed to calculate the total sales for \"Gold\" ticket types based on the data in the CSV file. The query sums the product of 'units' and 'price' for entries where the ticket 'type' (after converting to lowercase and trimming whitespace) equals 'gold'.",

It appears to be a tool for testing or interacting with a service that interprets and executes formulas in Google Sheets.\n\n**Key Parameters and Elements:**\n\n*   **Question (string):** A text input field labeled \"question\" that is marked as \"required\". The entered text \"Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY\\_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 9, 11), 1, 10)) what is this formula in google sheet?\" This input acts as the user's request or the formula to be processed. The question is highlighted because it's the primary input to the API.\n*   **File (string/null/binary):** A file upload option with radio button that allows the user to upload file for API request.\n*   **Execute Button:** A button that triggers the API call to the backend with the provided input.\n*   **Responses Section:** Displays the results of the API request. It includes:\n    *   **Curl Command:** The equivalent cURL command for making the same API request programmatically. The cURL command includes the `POST` method, the API endpoint URL, the `Content-Type`, and the request payload.\n    *   **Request URL:** The API endpoint URL.\n    *   **Server Response:**\n        *   **Code:** The HTTP status code returned by the server (200, indicating success).\n        *   **Response Body:** The JSON response from the server. In this case, `{\"answer\": 585}` is returned.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe tool allows users to submit Google Sheets formulas to an API, receive the processed result, and see the equivalent cURL command for replicating the request in a command-line environment. The highlighting emphasizes that the API is taking a spreadsheet formula as input and providing a calculated answer as a response.",

      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image, incorporating the key elements and highlighted sections:\n\n**Overall Image Description:**\n\nThe image shows a laptop screen displaying what appears to be a debugging or logging interface. The screen is divided into sections showing the status of a service, request logs, and laptop keyboard.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Top Section (Debugging Interface):**\n\n    *   **Status:** The service status is shown as \"online,\" indicating it is running.\n    *   **User Information:** \"Gaurav Ghodge (Plan: Free)\" suggests a user account and subscription level.\n    *   **Version:** The service version is \"3.22.0.\"\n    *   **Location:** \"India (in)\" represents the user's location.\n    *   **Latency:** \"24ms\" indicates network latency.\n    *   **URLs:** Two URLs are displayed, a local one (\"http://127.0.0.1:4040\") and an ngrok URL (\"https://c7f6-159-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app\"). Ngrok is often used to expose local servers to the internet for testing and development.\n    *   **Metrics:**  Values for \"ttl,\" \"opn,\" \"rt1,\" \"rt5,\" \"p50,\" and \"p90\" are present, suggesting network-related performance metrics.\n*   **Middle Section (Request Logs):**\n\n    *   **Timestamp:** Each line starts with a timestamp (e.g., \"53:08.409 IST\").\n    *   **HTTP Method:** All requests listed are \"POST.\"\n    *   **Endpoint:** The endpoint appears to be \"/api/\".\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** This is the highlighted section. It shows a mix of \"307 Temporary Redirect\" and \"200 OK\" responses.\n\n*   **Highlighted Sections (HTTP Status Codes):**\n\n    *   **307 Temporary Redirect:** Indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL. The client should repeat the request to the new URL.\n    *   **200 OK:** Indicates that the request was successful.\n    *   **Why Highlighted?:** The mix of these codes in the logs suggests that some requests are being redirected (potentially for load balancing, API versioning, or other reasons), while others are being processed directly. Developers often scrutinize 3xx status codes in logs to understand routing and redirection behaviors.\n\n*   **Bottom Section (Laptop Keyboard):**\n\n    *   A portion of the laptop keyboard is visible, showing function keys (F3, F4, F5, F6, F7) and number keys.\n    *   There is also a MacOS dock with various application icons.\n",

The \"F\" or lightning bolt is oriented diagonally, pointing towards the upper right of the circle.\n\n**Key Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Shape:** The primary shape is a stylized \"F\" or abstract lightning bolt. This shape likely represents speed, energy, or a brand name starting with \"F\".\n\n*   **Color:** The two main colors are white and teal. White provides contrast and highlights the logo shape. Teal is a popular color often associated with technology, communication, or modernity.\n\n*   **Composition:** The design is simple and clean. The single shape centered within a circle creates a balanced and memorable logo.\n\n*   **Purpose:** The image is most likely a logo for a company or organization. It could represent a tech company, a delivery service, a financial institution, or anything associated with speed and efficiency.\n\nSince the image does not have anything highlighted specifically, I am including all the parameters that should be highlighted.",

The form appears to be collecting information related to a programming project.  Specifically, it's asking for:\n\n*   **Work Email ID:** Recording the user's email address (`2412006749@ds.study.litm.ac.in`), suggesting that it is intended to be filled by college students.\n*   **GitHub Repository Link for Project 2:** The user has provided a link `https://github.com/Sakshi6749/PROJECT-2`. The surrounding text suggests the question is marked as mandatory with the use of asterik \"*\".\n*   **API Endpoint Link:** The user has provided `saakshi-llama.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com`. The form emphasizes the need for the endpoint to accept POST requests.\n\nA note is also there at the bottom \"Does this form look suspicious? Report\".\n\n**Highlighted Sections & Why:**\n\n*   The email address is implicitly highlighted because it's being recorded automatically by the form. This is a standard feature of Google Forms.\n\n*   The questions are highlighted to ensure that the details that are being asked are mandatory and is also indicated by asterisk \"*\".\n\n**Important Parameters/Topics:**\n\n*   **Google Forms:** The platform used to create the questionnaire.\n*   **GitHub:** A web based version control and collaboration platform for developers.\n*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules that allow different applications to communicate with each other.\n*   **POST Request:** A common HTTP method used to send data to a server to create or update a resource.\n*   **Project Assessment:**  The form's content indicates that it's likely being used for evaluating a programming project.\n*   **Cloud Deployment:** The use of `cloudapp.azure.com` suggests the API is hosted on Microsoft Azure's cloud platform.",

It details the specific time to turn on the server endpoint and clarifies what type of endpoints will be tested.\n\n**Key Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Sender:** 22t1 se2002\n*   **Recipient:** \"Dear Learner\"\n*   **Subject:** Re-run of P2 Evaluations\n*   **Reason:** Low Score\n*   **Action Required:** Turn on server endpoint.\n*   **Time:** 11:00 pm to 02:00 am \"TONIGHT\".\n*   **Evaluation Timing:** Evaluations start at 11:00 pm and end at 2:00 am.\n*   **Endpoint Submission Method:** Official forms only. Endpoints submitted through discourse or email will not be tested.\n*   **Endpoint Testing:** The latest endpoint submitted through the official form will be tested. If an updated endpoint was not submitted, the previous endpoint will be tested.\n*   **Endpoint Address:** A specific endpoint URL is provided: `https://e95b-2405-201-e04b-d085-9cf5-4f92-fe5a-309e.ngrok-free.app/ask`\n\n**Highlighted Parts:**\n\n*   **\"turn on your server endpoint from 11:00 pm to 02:00 am TONIGHT.\"** is emphasized to draw immediate attention to the critical timing requirement for the learner's server to be active for the evaluation.\n*   **\"NOT\"** is emphasized to highlight the fact that endpoints that were submitted in discourse or via email will not be tested.\n*   **\"(no other endpoint will be tested)\"** is emphasized to indicate the importance that no other endpoint other than the one mentioned at the bottom or the previous endpoint, will be tested.",

      "content": "@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\nDear Sirs,\nI apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.\nI would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as ‚ÄúAbsent,‚Äù despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.\nFor your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.\nI sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.\nI genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.\nThank you very much for your time and understanding.\napi link : https://tds-proj2f.vercel.app/\ngit949√ó580 62.4 KB",

      "image_description": "Here's a precise description of the image, including details on the highlighted parts:\n\n**Overall Description:**\n\nThe image shows the file listing for a public GitHub repository named \"tds_proj2f.\" It displays a typical directory structure with several files, their names, the last commit message (\"final commit\"), and the time since the last commit (2 weeks ago).\n\n**Highlighted Parts and Their Significance:**\n\n*   **Green \"Code\" button:** This button is highlighted to indicate the primary action a user might want to take on a repository: to download or view the code. It emphasizes the project's code-centric nature.\n\n**Important Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Repository Name:** `tds_proj2f` - The unique identifier of the project.\n*   **Visibility:** Public. This indicates that anyone can view the repository.\n*   **Branch:** `main`. Shows that the default branch is named \"main\"\n*   **Commit History:** The files all have \"final commit\". It is implied from the listing of the files that this is the only commit in the repository.\n*   **File Types:** The presence of `.env`, `.gitignore`, `.html`, `.md`, `.png`, and `.py` files suggests the project involves environment configuration, version control setup, web content, documentation, an image file and python programming.\n*   **File Names:** The files starting with \"ga\" implies a possible project naming scheme or a specific type of file within the project.\n*   **Last Updated:** All the files were last committed \"2 weeks ago\", suggesting a recent activity or initial project setup.\n*   **Navigation:** The \"Go to file\" search bar implies the capability to search within the repository.\n*   **Repository Actions:** The \"Add file\" and \"Code\" buttons suggest actions available to contributors and users, such as adding new files or accessing the code.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a GitHub repository with a simple structure, a recent \"final commit,\" and a mix of file types. The highlighted \"Code\" button draws attention to accessing the project's codebase.\n",

The subject line implies the user needs to upgrade their account. The email informs the recipient that their free credit has expired, resulting in the disabling of their subscription and services. It urges them to upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription to retain their configurations and data. The email highlights the benefits of upgrading:\n*   12 months of popular products for free.\n*   More than 25 products that are always free.\n\nIt notes that the user only pays for what they use each month and can cancel anytime. A prominent blue button encourages the user to \"Sign up for a new subscription.\" Finally, it warns that subscription data will be permanently deleted on April 14, 2025, urging the user to log in and save important data before then. The email was sent on Tuesday, April 15, 2025 at 3:39 AM.\n\n**Highlights and Why:**\n\n*   **\"Upgrade now to keep building in Azure\"**: This is the main call to action and emphasizes urgency and the benefit of continued service.\n*   **\"Your free credit has expired, so we've disabled your subscription and services.\"**: This clearly states the reason for the email and the consequence of inaction.\n*   **\"Sign up for a new subscription >\"**: This is the primary actionable item; clicking here initiates the upgrade process.\n*   **\"We'll keep your subscription data before permanently deleting it on April 14, 2025.\"**: This highlights the data loss deadline, creating a sense of urgency and motivating action before that date.\n\nThese elements are highlighted to capture the user's attention and guide them towards upgrading their subscription. The email structure is designed to present the problem (expired free credit), the solution (upgrade to paid subscription), the benefits, and the urgency (data deletion deadline) in a clear and concise manner.",

      "content": "*Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint\nDear @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton\nI hope you‚Äôre doing well!\nI‚Äôm currently running my server and  trying to access the API hosted at:\nhttps://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/\n\nHowever, I‚Äôm encountering the following error:\ncurl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app\n\nAfter some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using public DNS services like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1). This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).\n\n Suggested Fix:\nTo ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a public DNS provider?\nRecommended options:\n\nGoogle DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4\nCloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1\n\nThis can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment‚Äôs networking configuration.\n\n Alternate Option:\nIf the DNS change isn‚Äôt possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the previously deployed endpoint instead:\nhttps://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/\n\nPlease note that this endpoint may take 50 to 60 seconds to respond, as it‚Äôs hosted on a platform with a cold start delay ‚Äî but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.\nBoth endpoints are currently active and return identical results.\n\nThank you so much for your time and support ‚Äî I truly appreciate the effort you‚Äôre putting into helping us succeed in this course!\nBest regards,\nSahil Raj",

I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.\nAt that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it‚Äôs not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.\nI checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.\nAdditionally, I believe the image may show your server‚Äôs IP address.\nThank you!\n10000638561920√ó858 139 KB",

      "image_description": "Here's a concise description of the image, incorporating key details and highlighted elements:\n\n**Image Description:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a Windows PowerShell terminal displaying log outputs from a data science application. The logs indicate the processing of different Python files located within a \"data science tool\" directory structure (e.g., `E://data science tool//GA1//eighteenth.py`).  The log messages include:\n\n*   **File Processing Information:**  Lines start with \"ing question with file\" and \"lution for\",  showing the script file being processed.\n*   **API Access Logs:**  Lines containing an IP address (103.158.43.22) show API access attempts (POST requests to `/api/`) and confirmation ( \"200 OK\") with the timestamp.  These lines also indicate the IP address is being logged.\n*   **Data Analysis Results:**  Output also shows the result of some processes which include `score` and `confidence`.\n\n**Important Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Data Science Application:** The logs indicate the execution of a data science application.\n*   **File Paths:** The paths like `E://data science tool//GA1//eighteenth.py` are important for understanding the structure of the project.\n*   **API Interaction:**  The \"POST /api/\" lines signify interaction with an API, likely for data retrieval or submission. The \"200 OK\" confirms successful requests.\n*   **IP Address Logging:** The lines containing \"Logged IP 103.158.43.22 accessing /api/\" suggest the application is tracking and logging IP addresses accessing the API. This might be for security, monitoring, or analytics purposes.\n*   **Confidence Score:** The lines with `score` and `confidence` indicate some type of prediction and its confidence in prediction.\n*   **Context keywords:** There are also the context keywords such as openai, github and excel to explain the log line.\n\n**Overall:** The image shows a debugging or monitoring view of a data science application, capturing details about file processing, API interaction, IP address tracking, and the results of some process.",

The focus is on a segment that presents questions from what appears to be a Google Form.\n\n**Key Elements and Highlights:**\n\n*   **Google Form Questions:** Two questions are prominent:\n    *   \"What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2?\"\n    *   \"What is the link to your API endpoint?\"\n*   **Asterisks (\\*):** Both questions are marked with asterisks. Asterisks in forms typically indicate mandatory/required fields.\n*   **URL Example/Hint:**  Under the GitHub question, a sample URL format \"https://github.com/user-name/repository-name\" is provided as a guide.\n*   **Provided URLs:**\n    *   GitHub URL: `https://github.com/kartikayy1/project2final`\n    *   API Endpoint URL: `https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/`\n*   **API Endpoint Instructions:** The API endpoint question specifically asks the respondent to ensure a POST request can be sent to the provided URL.\n*   **Suspicion Prompt:** At the bottom, there is text: \"Create your own Google Form. Does this form look suspicious? Report\".\n* **\"99+\"**: There is a '99+' notification on the messaging or email application icon.\n\n**In summary:** The image shows a screenshot of an email or message interface with questions from a form about Github URL and API endpoints. It also includes a prompt asking if the form appears suspicious. The asterisks and API endpoint instruction highlight the important aspects of the questions and URLs provided.",

      "image_description": "Here's a concise description of the image, including details about highlighted sections and key parameters:\n\n**Image Description:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a terminal or command-line interface, likely PowerShell, showing an HTTP request and its response. The user sends a POST request to a Vercel-hosted API (\"https://tds-solver-lyart.vercel.app/api/\") with a question parameter. The question involves a Google Sheets formula: `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 7), 1, 10))`.  The comment emphasizes that the formula is intended for Google Sheets and will not work in Excel. The server returns a JSON response indicating the answer to the formula is 465 and the status is \"success\".\n\n**Highlighted Sections and Significance:**\n\n*   **`http -f POST \"https://tds-solver-lyart.vercel.app/api/\" question=\"`**:  This line contains the shell command that initiates the HTTP POST request. `http` likely refers to a command-line HTTP client. `-f` means that the post is followed by a formula which is a google sheets formula. `POST` is the request method. `https://tds-solver-lyart.vercel.app/api/` is the targeted server url and the question is sent in the form of `question=`.\n*   **`HTTP/1.1 200 OK`**: This indicates a successful HTTP response, meaning the server processed the request without errors. 200 is the HTTP success code.\n*   **`\"answer\": 465` and `\"status\": \"success\"`**: This is the relevant data returned by the server, providing the solution to the Google Sheets formula and a confirmation of successful processing.\n\n**Key Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **API Endpoint:**  `https://tds-solver-lyart.vercel.app/api/` (The target URL of the API).\n*   **Request Method:** POST\n*   **Data Format:** JSON (as indicated by `Content-Type: application/json`).\n*   **Date:** Thu, 17 Apr 2025 04:23:01 GMT\n*   **Server:** Vercel\n*   **Google Sheets Formula:**  `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 7), 1, 10))` (The specific calculation being performed).\n*   **Content-Length:** 33 bytes in the response body.\n*   **Cache-Control:** public, max-age=0, must-revalidate\n*   **Strict-Transport-Security:** To ensure it's secure.\n*   **Answer:** 465\n*   **Status:** success\n\nIn essence, the image captures a user interacting with a simple API to evaluate a Google Sheets formula from the command line.\n",

      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image, incorporating the key parameters and information:\n\n**Image Description:**\n\nThe image displays a JSON array of objects, each representing the results of API tests.  The content appears to be output from a command-line interface or a console log.\n\n**Key Parameters & Topics:**\n\n*   **`api`**:  The URL `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` indicates the endpoint that was tested.\n*   **`test_code`**: Each object has a unique test code such as `GA1_q18`, `GA4_q6`, `GA2_q3`, `GA3_q2`, and `GA5_q7`.  This likely identifies a specific test case.\n*   **`status`**:  The status is uniformly `FAILED` for all tests in this excerpt. This indicates that all the tests represented in this section of the log did not pass.\n*   **`error`**: Each test has an error message `HTTP 400: {\\\"error\\\":\\\"Missing question or file\\\"}`. An HTTP 400 error suggests a \"Bad Request\". The specific error message indicates that either a required question or file was not provided in the request to the API.\n\n**Highlights & Implications:**\n\nThe fact that all statuses are \"FAILED\" and have the same \"Missing question or file\" error is significant. It suggests a common problem across all these test cases, pointing to one of the following issues:\n\n1.  **Client-Side Error:** There might be an error in the way the test requests are being formulated (the client-side logic sending the requests to the API). The tests aren't providing the necessary data to the API.\n\n2.  **API Error:** The API might have a bug where it's incorrectly reporting the need for a missing question or file even when it's present in the request.\n\n3.  **Configuration Error:** Perhaps there's a configuration issue where the testing environment is not properly set up to provide the necessary data to the API.\n\nIn summary, the image shows multiple failing API tests due to a \"Missing question or file\" error, which needs investigation to determine the root cause (client, API, or configuration problem).",

      "image_description": "Here is a description of the image:\n\nThe image displays a JSON structure containing error information related to API calls.  The structure consists of an array containing two objects. Each object has the following keys:\n\n*   `api`: Contains the URL of the API endpoint. In both instances, the URL is `https://tds-solver-bml0qi7k5-adityas-projects-07f86c8b.vercel.app/`.\n\n*   `test_code`: A string representing a test identifier. The first object has `GA1_q18`, and the second object has `GA4_q6`.\n\n*   `status`:  Indicates the status of the API call, which is `FAILED` in both cases. This is a crucial piece of information indicating a problem.\n\n*   `error`: Contains a string with details about the error.  Both errors are HTTP 405 errors, indicating that the method used to access the URL is not allowed.  The error message includes HTML markup with the title and main heading \"405 Method Not Allowed,\" indicating that the server is explicitly refusing the HTTP method used in the request.\n\n**Key parameters and topics:**\n\n*   **API Error Handling:** The JSON structure is designed to convey error information from an API.\n*   **HTTP Status Code 405:** The core issue is a \"405 Method Not Allowed\" error. This means the server recognizes the resource but the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used in the request is not supported for that specific resource.\n*   **Vercel:** The API URL points to a Vercel deployment, suggesting a serverless application.\n*   **JSON Data Format:** The data is structured in JSON, a standard format for data exchange in web applications.\n*   **Debugging and Troubleshooting:** This error information is essential for debugging API issues, particularly concerning the allowed HTTP methods for different endpoints.\n*   **API Endpoint:**  The `api` field specifies the endpoint where the error occurred.\n\n**Why are parts highlighted (though not visually highlighted here):**\n\n*   `\"status\": \"FAILED\"` is important as it highlights that the intended operation was unsuccessful.\n*   `\"error\": \"HTTP 405: ...\"` is critical as it provides specific details of the error, the HTTP status code and a message explaining the reason. This information is key to understanding and resolving the issue.  The full HTML in the error message further clarifies the nature of the 405 error.",

The purpose of this test seems to be validating the application's response when a ZIP file without a CSV is uploaded.\n\n**Request Details**\n\n*   **Method:** POST\n*   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`\n*   **Request Body:**\n    *   **Type:** `form-data`\n    *   **Fields:**\n        *   `question`: \"What is the value in the \"answer\" column of the...\" (Text)\n        *   `file`:  `q-move-rename-files.zip` (File)\n*   **Headers:** The image shows \"Headers (9)\", which means that there are nine headers defined, though the details of those are not visible in the image.\n\n**Response Details**\n\n*   **Status Code:** `400 Bad Request`\n*   **Response Time:** 846 ms\n*   **Response Size:** 434 B\n*   **Response Body:** JSON with the following content:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"error\": \"No CSV file found in zip.\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n**Highlights and their significance**\n\n*   **The note \"Changed the zip file which doesn't have any CSV.\":** This explains the test's intention. The user intentionally provided a ZIP file that is known *not* to contain a CSV file to trigger an error condition and see if the API handles it correctly.\n*   **The note \"Got the expected error response :)\":** This confirms that the API *did* indeed respond with the expected error message (\"No CSV file found in zip.\"), meaning the test was successful in validating this error case.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n*   The API expects a ZIP file containing a CSV file.\n*   The API correctly identifies and reports when a ZIP file lacks a CSV file, returning a `400 Bad Request` error with an appropriate error message.\n*   This image documents a successful negative test case for the API, showing that it handles incorrect input gracefully.",

I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn‚Äôt get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully.\nProject-2 Evaluation\nRegarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage.\nSir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks.\nIn anticipation of quick response\nThank You",

      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image, incorporating the highlighted elements and their context:\n\n**Overall Description:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a Gmail inbox, specifically an email titled \"TDS Project 2 Endpoints\".  The email is displayed within the Gmail web interface, showing the sender's message content in the main reading pane. The email body is a notification to learners regarding changes to their \"Project 2 Endpoints\" due to backend operational updates.\n\n**Highlighted Sections and Their Significance:**\n\n*   **\"TDS Project 2 Endpoints\"**: This is the subject of the email and the title of the form. It is highlighted in yellow to clearly identify the purpose and focus of the communication. It concerns a specific project (\"Project 2\") that requires attention to its endpoints.\n*   **\"Project 2 Endpoints\"**: This section within the email is highlighted to emphasizes the area where changes have occurred. This highlights an important detail with regards to this message\n\n**Key Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **Email Platform:** Gmail (indicated by the Gmail logo and interface)\n*   **Email Subject:** TDS Project 2 Endpoints\n*   **Sender:** Likely related to IIT Madras (indicated by the IIT Madras logo in the upper right)\n*   **Recipient:** \"Dear Learner,\" suggesting a student or course participant.\n*   **Content:** The email informs recipients about:\n    *   Operational changes in the backend leading to potential URL changes.\n    *   The need to restart servers or make other changes to keep endpoints alive.\n    *   A form created to update endpoint information.\n    *   A reminder that their email address has been recorded.\n    *   A request to update endpoints via the form if changes have occurred.\n    *   A warning against submitting multiple forms.\n*   **Importance:** The email is important because it requires the recipient to take action to update their project endpoints due to unexpected backend changes.  Failure to update could lead to project issues or downtime.\n*   **Form Access:** The email directs the recipient to an \"Edit response\" button to update their endpoints via a form, which implies a Google Forms or similar data collection mechanism.\n*   **Email Address Recorded:** The email confirms that the recipient's email (23f1002942@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded upon previous form submission, assuring personalization and proper identification.\n\nIn short, the image captures an important communication concerning a university project that requires students to address potential endpoint changes resulting from recent backend updates.\n",

      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image, focusing on the key elements and highlighted information:\n\n**Image Description:**\n\nThe image is a snippet from a console or log file, displaying network traffic information.  Each line represents an HTTP request made to a server.  The primary focus is on a series of \"GET\" requests (and a few \"CONNECT\" requests) from various IP addresses.  The requests are failing, indicated by the consistent \"404 Not Found\" status code.\n\n**Key Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **IP Addresses and Ports:** Each line starts with an IP address and port number (e.g., \"123.160.223.72:54416\"). This identifies the client making the request.\n*   **HTTP Request Type:** Most lines show \"GET\" requests, followed by the requested resource (e.g., \"/\", \"/login\", \"/favicon.ico\"). A few show \"PRI \\* HTTP/2.0\" and \"CONNECT\".\n*   **HTTP Version:** The HTTP version is specified (e.g., \"HTTP/1.1\", \"HTTP/1.0\", \"HTTP/2.0\").\n*   **Status Code:** Every request results in a \"404 Not Found\" status code, signifying that the requested resource was not found on the server.\n*   **Squid-Internal-Mgr:** Some requests target \"/squid-internal-mgr/cachemgr.cgi\", indicating an attempt to access a Squid proxy manager interface.\n*   **API Request:** One request targets \"http%3A//api.ipify.org/?format=json\", suggesting an attempt to retrieve the client's public IP address using the ipify API.\n*   **Shadowserver:** One request tries to connect to \"www.shadowserver.org%3A443\", likely related to network security or scanning activities.\n*   **Warning Messages:** Interspersed within the log are \"WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.\" messages. This means the server couldn't parse or understand the HTTP request.\n*   **Favicon Requests:** Several requests target \"/favicon.ico\", which is a standard request for a website's icon.\n\n**Highlights and Why:**\n\nThere isn't any highlighting in the classical sense. However, the pattern that is being set in the image makes the below as highlighted ones:\n\n*   **\"404 Not Found\"**: Is consistent and indicates that a resource on the server could not be located. It's a clear error message that stands out due to its repetition.\n*   **\"Invalid HTTP request received.\"**: Signifies that the server is encountering problems interpreting the request.\n*   **Different types of HTTP requests**: Different types of requests also create highlights.\n\n**In summary,** the image depicts a series of failed HTTP requests to a server, often resulting in \"404 Not Found\" errors and warnings about invalid HTTP requests. The variety of requests (standard pages, favicon, API calls, Squid manager) suggests either misconfiguration, malicious activity, or a server that's intentionally returning errors.\n",

      "image_description": "Here's a description of the image, focusing on the important details and highlighted sections:\n\n**Overview:**\n\nThe image shows a Python script (`Q23.py`) hosted on GitHub within the `TDS-Hackers/GASolver` repository, specifically in the `GA2` directory.  The script appears to be related to retrieving or accessing user portfolios based on email addresses. The filename `Q23.py` is highlighted in the left sidebar, showing that this particular file is currently being viewed.\n\n**Key Parameters and Topics:**\n\n*   **`TDS-Hackers/GASolver`:** The GitHub repository name, indicating a team or organization working on a solver.\n*   **`GA2/Q23.py`:** The path to the specific Python file being displayed.\n*   **`import os, json`:** Imports libraries for OS interaction and JSON handling.\n*   **`execute(question: str, parameter:)`:** A function definition, suggesting that the script might be part of a question answering system or a more extensive application. It accepts two parameters: `question` of string type and `parameter`.\n*   **`cache = { ... }`:** A dictionary (`cache`) stores email addresses as keys and corresponding GitHub repository URLs as values. This suggests that the script might be caching user portfolios. This entire `cache` dictionary is highlighted as well.\n*   **Email to GitHub URL Mapping:** The cache dictionary contains pairs of email addresses and corresponding GitHub profile URLs. The email domain `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is prominent, hinting that this script is related to the IIT Madras educational domain.\n\n**Highlighted Elements and Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **`Q23.py` (in the file list):** Highlighted because it is the currently selected or active file being displayed in the code view.\n2.  **`cache = { ... }`:** Highlighting this dictionary suggests its importance to the script's functionality. It contains the mapping of email addresses to github urls. This is very important because it is the core functionality of the script.\n\n**Script Functionality (Inferred):**\n\nThe script likely takes an email address as input via the `parameter[\"email\"]`, checks if that email exists as a key in the `cache` dictionary, and returns the associated GitHub repository URL. If the email is not found in the `cache`, the script returns a string indicating that the value is not present in the cache.\n",

Over the last few months, I‚Äôve built a personal project called ‚ÄúVicky App‚Äù ‚Äî a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like TDS,.\nThe system is capable of:\n\nAccurately solving over 90% of assignment-style questions using regex and phonetic matching\nDynamically executing the right code logic based on the student‚Äôs input\nProcessing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON\nDelivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM\n\nYou can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech\n\n What‚Äôs in it for students:\n\nThey type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically\nEspecially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload\nI‚Äôve made it free for the first 3 questions\nAfter that, students can access the full platform for just ‚Çπ199/month, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs\n\n\n My Humble Request:\nThis is a tool I‚Äôve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.\nTo sustain the platform ‚Äî hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration ‚Äî I‚Äôve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.\nI would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.\nIt‚Äôs built by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students ‚Äî with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.\nThank you so much for your time and support.\nWarm regards,\nVicky Kumar\nB.S. Data Science and Applications, IIT Madras\n npdimagine@gmail.com |  +91 8383848219\n Portfolio | LinkedIn\nIt‚Äôs a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program ‚Äî not to replace learning, but to accelerate it.\nPlease let me know if you‚Äôd like a walkthrough, or if any suggestions for improvements arise.\nWarm regards,\nVicky Kumar\nB.S.
