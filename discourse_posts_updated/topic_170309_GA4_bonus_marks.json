      "image_description": "The image shows a promotional notice. The primary message is that students can earn bonus marks for posting on \"Discourse\". Specifically, IITM BS students who contribute to the \"GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]\" with a 'relevant' question or reply will receive a 1-point bonus on their graded assignment. The terms \"GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]\" and \"relevant\" are highlighted, likely to draw attention to the specific forum and the quality of contribution required for bonus marks.",
