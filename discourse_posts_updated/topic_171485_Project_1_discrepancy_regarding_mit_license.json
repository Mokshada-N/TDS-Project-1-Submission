      "image_description": "Here's a precise description of the image, highlighting important parameters and topics:\n\n**Overview:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository interface.  The repository name is \"tds_project-1\" and it is public. The view is set to the \"main\" branch, which has 1 branch and no tags.\n\n**File Structure and Highlights:**\n\nThe repository's file structure is displayed. Here's a breakdown, focusing on key aspects:\n\n*   **`_pycache_`:**  This is a directory typically generated by Python for storing compiled bytecode files for faster execution.\n*   **`venv`:** A virtual environment directory. It's crucial for managing project dependencies in isolation.\n*   **`Dockerfile`:** This file contains instructions for building a Docker image. Its presence indicates the project is containerized.\n*   **`LICENSE` and `MIT LICENSE`**: The \"LICENSE\" file was recently created (\"now\"). The renaming of a LICENSE to MIT LICENSE is visible, which signifies the choice of a license, specifically the MIT License, which is a common open-source license.  It's highlighted because it indicates the project is actively being managed and the license is being handled.\n*   **`app.py`:** This file likely contains the main application code (likely written in Python due to the .py extension).\n*   **`requirements.txt`:** A text file listing the Python packages required for the project. This is essential for dependency management.\n*   **`test.txt`**: Appears to be a test file\n*   The descriptions next to the filenames indicate when they were last modified and provide a brief commit message.\n\n**Repository Metadata:**\n\n*   **Commit History:** \"6 Commits\" are reported to the repository.\n*   **Commit ID:** A recent commit (c61a6ef) is shown, \"c61a6ef-now\" along with the commit message \"Create LICENSE\".\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   This appears to be a Python project.\n*   The project is containerized (Dockerfile).\n*   The project uses a virtual environment (venv) for dependency management.\n*   The project is using the MIT license.\n\n**UI Elements:**\n\n*   The GitHub UI shows standard options like \"Go to file\", \"Add file\", and a \"Code\" button.\n*   \"Pin\" and \"Unwatch\" are available in the upper right corner.\n",

      "image_description": "The image shows a message indicating a failed submission due to several reasons. A GitHub repository URL is provided, and the subsequent text explains that the submission failed because there is \"No such repo\", no \"MIT\" license in the LICENSE file, and no Dockerfile in the repository.\n\nThe phrases \"No such repo\", \"MIT\", and \"Dockerfile\" are highlighted, presumably to emphasize the reasons for the failed submission. The MIT license is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. These are critical components of many software projects, and their absence can lead to a submission failure.",

      "image_description": "Here's a concise description of the image:\n\nThe image contains text outlining submission requirements and guidelines. It states:\n1.  \"No 'MIT' in LICENSE; No Dockerfile\" - This appears to be a checklist item indicating that submissions shouldn't contain the MIT license or a Dockerfile.\n2.  It stresses that submissions must pass this checklist to be considered for scoring.\n3.  It notes that only the 'latest' submissions will be considered, likely because students were allowed multiple submissions.\n\nThe word \"latest\" is highlighted, indicating emphasis on this rule.  This is important because it informs students that they don't have to worry about any errors in their old submissions, the only submissions that will be considered are the latest ones.",

      "content": "@24ds2000125 @22f3000585\nI completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.\nBut the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.\nUnfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.\nChanging it now will not suddenly make it eligible.\nThese things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.\nIts a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.\nWe had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.\nI know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.\nKindest regards",
